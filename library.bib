abstract = {Decades of quantitative measurement indicate that roots can mechanically reinforce shallow soils in forested landscapes. Forests, however, have variations in vegetation species and age which can dominate the local stability of landslide-initiation sites. To assess the influence of this variability on root cohesion we examined scarps of landslides triggered during large storms in February and November of 1996 in the Oregon Coast Range and hand-dug soil pits on stable ground. At 41 sites we estimated the cohesive reinforcement to soil due to roots by determining the tensile strength, species, depth, orientation, relative health, and the density of roots ≥1 mm in diameter within a measured soil area. We found that median lateral root cohesion ranges from 6.8-23.2 kPa in industrial forests with significant understory and deciduous vegetation to 25.6-94.3 kPa in natural forests dominated by coniferous vegetation. Lateral root cohesion in clearcuts is uniformly ≤10 kPa. Some 100-year-old industrial forests have species compositions, lateral root cohesion, and root diameters that more closely resemble 10-year-old clearcuts than natural forests. As such, the influence of root cohesion variability on landslide susceptibility cannot be determined solely from broad age classifications or extrapolated from the presence of one species of vegetation. Furthermore, the anthropogenic disturbance legacy modifies root cohesion for at least a century and should be considered when comparing contemporary landslide rates from industrial forests with geologic background rates.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to extracting spatially and temporally continuous ground deformation fields from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data. We focus on unwrapped interferograms from a single viewing geometry, estimating ground deformation along the line-of-sight. Our approach is based on a wavelet decomposition in space and a general parametrization in time. We refer to this approach as MInTS (Multiscale InSAR Time Series). The wavelet decomposition efficiently deals with commonly seen spatial covariances in repeat-pass InSAR measurements, since the coefficients of the wavelets are essentially spatially uncorrelated. Our time-dependent parametrization is capable of capturing both recognized and unrecognized processes, and is not arbitrarily tied to the times of the SAR acquisitions. We estimate deformation in the wavelet-domain, using a cross-validated, regularized least squares inversion. We include a model-resolution-based regularization, in order to more heavily damp the model during periods of sparse SAR acquisitions, compared to during times of dense acquisitions. To illustrate the application of MInTS, we consider a catalog of 92 ERS and Envisat interferograms, spanning 16 years, in the Long Valley caldera, CA, region. MInTS analysis captures the ground deformation with high spatial density over the Long Valley region. Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

@article{Fukuzono1985,
abstract = {n order to study the process of slope failure caused by heavy rainfall, some large scale slope models of loamy and sandy materials were constructed. Artificial rainfall was applied to these models until a large scale failure occurred. Surface displacement were monitored by extensometers set on the models from the beginning of experiment to the final failure. Through analysis of the data, a rule on slope movement in the process of failure was found. The increment of the logarithm of velocity of surface displacement is proportional to the logarithm of acceleration of the surface displacement in the final stage of the slope movement just before the failure. That is d2$\chi$/dt2=a (d$\chi$/dt) $\alpha$where $\chi$ is downward surface displacement along the slope, t means time, d2$\chi$ and d$\chi$/dt show acceleration and velocity of surface displacement, a and $\alpha$a are constants. Usually, $\alpha$ took 1.5 to 2.2 in range in the experiments. From the integration of the equation for the range of $\alpha${\textgreater}1, an equation, 1/$\upsilon$ = {\{}a ($\alpha$-1){\}} 1/ ($\alpha$-1) (t$\gamma$-t) 1/ ($\alpha$-1) is obtained, were 1/$\upsilon$ is 1/ (d$\chi$/dt), that is inverse number of velocity and t$\gamma$ is a constant of integration. The equation shows that the curve written by each point of t and 1/$\upsilon$ is linear if $\alpha$=2, convex if $\alpha${\textgreater}2 and concave if 1{\textless}$\alpha${\textless}2 and that the value uniformly decreases. In the case of $\alpha$=2, the failure time of a slope can be predicted exactly from the time (t$\gamma$) when 1/$\upsilon$ equals 0 (infinite velocity). Furthermore, the equation can be modified as (1/$\upsilon$) / (d (1/$\upsilon$) /dt) = ($\alpha$-1) (tr-t). The equation shows that the curve written by each point of t and (1/$\upsilon$) / (d (1/$\upsilon$) /dt) is linear for the range of $\alpha${\textgreater}1. Based on the relations mentioned above, the failure time of a slope can be predicted exactly in the case of $\alpha$≠2. Also a graphical method to show the failure time, based on the equation, is proposed.},

The SMC product, which is to be generated from Sentinel-1 data, requires an algorithm capable of processing operationally in near-real-time and delivering the product to the GMES services within 3. h from observation. An approach based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been proposed that represents a good compromise between retrieval accuracy and processing time, thus enabling compliance with the timeliness requirements. The algorithm has been tested and subsequently validated in several test areas in Italy, Australia, and Spain.In all cases the validation results were very much in line with GMES requirements (with RMSE generally {\textless}. 4{\%}SMC - between 1.67{\%}SMC and 6.68{\%}SMC - and very low bias), except for the case of the test area in Spain, where the validation results were penalized by the availability of only VV polarized SAR images and MODIS low-resolution NDVI. Nonetheless, the obtained RMSE was slightly higher than 4{\%}SMC. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Soil moisture is an important hydrologic variable of great consequence in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to accurately assess the spatial and temporal variability of surface soil moisture using conventional, point measurement techniques. Remote sensing has the potential to provide areal estimates of soil moisture at a variety of spatial scales. This investigation evaluates the use of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) C-band, VV polarization, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for regional estimates of surface soil moisture. Radar data were acquired for three contiguous ERS-2 scenes in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of central Oklahoma from June 1999 to October 2000. Twelve test sites (each approximately 800 m x 800 m) were sampled during the ERS-2 satellite overpasses in order to monitor changes in soil moisture and vegetation on the ground. An average radar backscattering coefficient was calculated for each test site. Landsat-5 and -7 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the experimental sites close in time to the ERS-2 acquisition dates were also analysed. The TM scenes were used to monitor land cover changes and to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Land cover and ground data were used to interpret the radar-derived soil moisture data. Linear relationships between soil moisture and the backscattering coefficient were established. Using these equations, soil moisture maps of the Little Washita and the El Reno test areas were produced.},

abstract = {Slow-moving landslides exhibit persistent downslope motion with variations in velocity driven by transient stress perturbations along the sliding surface. Here, we use satellite InSAR and high-resolution topographic data to identify 50 slow-moving landslides in the Northern California Coast Ranges, and monitor their seasonal kinematics over 4. years. These landslides have similar mechanical properties and are subject to the same external forcings, which allows us to explore geometrical controls on kinematics. To overcome errors associated with large deformation gradients we incorporate a deformation model in the InSAR processing that enables us to generate deformation time series. We test our novel methodology using a synthetic deformation time series, confirming our ability to resolve seasonal velocity patterns. Time series analysis of four representative landslides reveals that seasonal velocity changes are characterized by comparatively rapid acceleration and gradual deceleration. Each slide displays distinct kinematic zones with different mean velocities, although velocity changes appear to occur synchronously along the landslide body over seasonal timescales. Because these deformation patterns are sensitive to subsurface geometry, we employ a commonly used non-Newtonian viscous flow law to infer slide thickness and find that these slides likely exhibit a highly variable thickness and an irregular (i.e. rough and non-planar) basal sliding surface. Our results suggest that slide geometry controls long-term motion, but does not strongly regulate their response to seasonal stress perturbations.},

Then, a review of the main PSI algorithms proposed in the literature is provided, describing the main approaches and the most important works devoted to single aspects of PSI. A central part of this paper is devoted to the discussion of different characteristics and technical aspects of PSI, e.g. SAR data availability, maximum deformation rates, deformation time series, thermal expansion component of PSI observations, etc. The paper then goes through the most important PSI validation activities, which have provided valuable inputs for the PSI development and its acceptability at scientific, technical and commercial level. This is followed by a description of the main PSI applications developed in the last fifteen years. The paper concludes with a discussion of the main open PSI problems and the associated future research lines.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Forecasting the time of failure of landslides at slope-scale is a difficult yet important task that can mitigate the effects of slope failures in terms of both human lives and economic losses. Common applications include public safety situations, where the risk is represented by dwellings built near active landslides or unstable cut slopes that threaten streets and railways, and open-pit mines, for which accurate warnings are fundamental to safeguard workers and simultaneously avoid unnecessary interruptions of the extraction activities. The scientific literature is populated by many methods, guidelines and approaches regarding forecasting the time of failure or defining the conditions of imminent collapse. Thus, obtaining a synoptic view of the advantages and limitations of these different methodologies has become difficult. At the same time, innovations in technology have opened new possibilities to the application of such techniques, which are examined here. This paper discusses and classifies these methods, addressing their respective differences and peculiarities to foster the usage even of less popular methods without overlooking the more scientific aspects and issues of landslide forecasting. Finally, an overview of the future trends and challenges is presented to contribute to the debate around this important topic.},

abstract = {The right-lateral San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system (SGHF) extends mainly offshore for about 400 km along the central California coast and is a major structure in the distributed transform margin of western North America. We mapped a poorly known 64-km-long section of the SGHF offshore Big Sur between Piedras Blancas and Point Sur using high-resolution bathymetry, seismic reflection, and marine magnetic data. In this region, the SGHF is characterized by multiple strands, step overs, scarps and lineaments, shutter ridges, deflected drainages, and other geomorphic features consistent with strike-slip faulting. Analysis of offset shelfbreak gullies suggest a lateral slip rate of about 3.35 mm/year. Vertical slip rates range as high as 0.8 to 1.2 mm/year. Lateral slip combined with high vertical slip rates result in a northwest decrease in shelf width, a northward increase in shelf and upper slope gradient, and progressive incision of submarine canyon heads. The SGHF between Point Sur and Piedras Blancas trends {\~{}}321° and forms a 105-km-long transpressive bend (the Big Sur Bend) between more north trending transtensional fault sections to the south (120 km long, {\~{}}336° trend) and north (180 km long, {\~{}}337° trend). This transpressional bend and SGHF splay faults have had a significant role in shaping the modern geomorphology of the central California coast, controlling or influencing the locations of mountainous uplifts, large coastal headlands, embayments, and rivers.},

Projected future changes in such dry-to-wet events, however, remain inadequately quantified, which we investigate here using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble of climate model simulations. Anthropogenic forcing is found to yield large twenty-first-century increases in the frequency of wet extremes, including a more than threefold increase in sub-seasonal events comparable to California's 'Great Flood of 1862'. Smaller but statistically robust increases in dry extremes are also apparent. As a consequence, a 25{\%} to 100{\%} increase in extreme dry-to-wet precipitation events is projected, despite only modest changes in mean precipitation. Such hydrological cycle intensification would seriously challenge California's existing water storage, conveyance and flood control infrastructure.},

abstract = {Detection of changes caused by major events-such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and floods-from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is challenging because of the coupled effects with temporal decorrelation caused by natural phenomena, including rain, snow, wind, and seasonal changes. The coupled effect of major events and natural phenomena sometimes leads to misinterpretation of interferometric coherence maps and often degrades the performance of change detection algorithms. To differentiate decorrelation sources caused by natural changes from those caused by an event of interest, we formulated a temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion of canopy elements, temporally correlated dielectric changes, and temporally uncorrelated dielectric changes of canopy and ground. The model parameters are extracted from the interferometric pairs associated with natural changes in canopy and ground using the proposed temporal decorrelation model. In addition, the cumulative distribution functions of the temporally uncorrelated model parameters, which are associated with natural changes in canopy and ground, are estimated from interferometric pairs acquired before the event. Model parameters are also extracted from interferometric SAR data acquired across the event and compared with the cumulative probabilities of natural changes in order to calculate the probability of a major event. Subsequently, pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 75{\%} are marked as changed due to the event. A case study for detecting volcanic ash during the eruption of the Shinmoedake volcano in January 2011 was carried out using L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite PALSAR data.},

abstract = {Despite landslides impact the society worldwide every day, landslide information isinhomogeneous and lacking. When landslides occur in remote areas or where the availability ofoptical images is rare due to cloud persistence, they might remain unknown, or unnoticed for longtime, preventing studies and hampering civil protection operations. The unprecedented availabilityof SAR C-band images provided by the Sentinel-1 constellation offers the opportunity to proposenew solutions to detect landslides events. In this work, we perform a systematic assessment ofSentinel-1 SAR C-band images acquired before and after known events. We present the resultsof a pilot study on 32 worldwide cases of rapid landslides entailing different types, sizes, slopeexpositions, as well as pre-existing land cover, triggering factors and climatic regimes. Results showthat in about eighty-four percent of the cases, changes caused by landslides on SAR amplitudesare unambiguous, whereas only in about thirteen percent of the cases there is no evidence. On theother hand, the signal does not allow for a systematic use to produce inventories because only in8 cases, a delineation of the landslide borders (i.e., mapping) can be manually attempted. In a fewcases, cascade multi-hazard (e.g., floods caused by landslides) and evidences of extreme triggeringfactors (e.g., strong earthquakes or very rapid snow melting) were detected. The method promises toincrease the availability of information on landslides at different spatial and temporal scales withbenefits for event magnitude assessment during weather-related emergencies, model tuning, andlandslide forecast model validation, in particular when accurate mapping is not required.},

abstract = {Ice flow can transfer variations in basal topography and basal slipperiness to the ice surface. Recent developments in this theory have made it possible to conduct numerical experiments to predict mesoscale surface topographical undulations and surface relief on an ice sheet-scale. Focussing here on the contemporary Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), we demonstrate that the theory can be used to predict the surface relief of the ice sheet from bed topography, ice thickness and basal slip ratio datasets. In certain regions of the GrIS our approach overestimates, while in others underestimates, the observed surface relief. The magnitude and spatial pattern of these mismatches correspond with the theory's limitations and known uncertainties in the bed topography and basal slip ratio datasets. Our prediction experiment establishes that the first-order control on GrIS surface relief is basal topography modulated by ice thickness, surface slope and basal slip ratio. Additional analyses show that the surface relief, which is controlled by the bed-to-surface transfer of basal topography, preconditions the large scale spatial structure of surface drainage, with other factors such as surface runoff modulating the actual drainage system through influencing the temporal evolution of meltwater features. It follows that the spatial structure of surface drainage depends strongly on the transfer of basal topography to the ice surface. These findings represent an important step toward investigating and understanding the net long-term ({\textgreater}102 years) effect of surface drainage on ice sheet mass balance and dynamics during deglaciation events.},

We report on the 2017, 3.0 × 106 m3 failure on Pizzo Cengalo in Switzerland, which led to human casualties and significant damage to infrastructure. Based on remote sensing and field investigations, we find a change in critical slope stability prior to failure for which permafrost may have played a destabilizing role. The resulting rock avalanche traveled for 3.2 km and removed over one million m3 of glacier ice and debris deposits from a previous rock avalanche in 2011. Whereas this entrainment did not lead to an unusually large runout distance, it favored debris flow activity from the 2017 rock avalanche deposits: the first debris flow occurred with a delay of 30 s followed by ten debris flows within 9.5 h and two additional events two days later, notably in the absence of rainfall. We hypothesize that entrainment and impact loading of saturated sediments explain the initial mobility of the 2017 rock avalanche deposits leading to a near-immediate initiation of debris flows. This explains why an earlier rock avalanche at the same site in 2011 was not directly followed by debris flows and underlines the importance of considering sediment saturation in a rock avalanche's runout path for Alpine hazard assessments.},

abstract = {Rockslides have a high socioeconomic and environmental importance in many countries. Norway is particularly susceptible to large rockslides due to its many fjords and steep mountains. One of the most dangerous hazards related with rock slope failures are tsunamis that can lead to large loss of life. It is therefore very important to systematically identify potential unstable rock slopes. Traditional landslide monitoring techniques are expensive and time consuming. Differential satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable tool for land displacement monitoring. Improved access to time series of satellite data has led to the development of several innovative multitemporal algorithms. Small baseline (SB) methods are based on combining and inverting a set of unwrapped interferograms that are computed with a small perpendicular baseline in order to reduce spatial phase decorrelation. Another well proven technique is the persistent scatterer interferometric method (PSI) that is based on analysis of persistent point targets. In this paper, we apply both approaches to study several rockslide sites in Troms County in the far north of Norway. Moreover, we take the opportunity to address the difference and similarities between the SB and the PSI multitemporal InSAR methods for displacement studies in rural terrain. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Recently, object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been employed for EO-based landslide (change) mapping. The proposed object-based approach has been tested for a sub-area of the Baichi catchment in northern Taiwan. The focus is on the mapping of landslides and debris flows/sediment transport areas caused by the Typhoons Aere in 2004 and Matsa in 2005. For both events, pre- and post-disaster optical satellite images (SPOT-5 with 2.5 m spatial resolution) were analysed. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with 5 m spatial resolution and its derived products, i.e., slope and curvature, were additionally integrated in the analysis to support the semi-automated object-based landslide mapping. Changes were identified by comparing the normalised values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) of segmentation-derived image objects between pre- and post-event images and attributed to landslide classes.},

abstract = {Mountain permafrost is invisible, and mapping it is still a challenge. Available permafrost distribution maps often overestimate the permafrost extent and include large permafrost-free areas in their permafrost zonation. In addition, the representation of the lower belt of permafrost consisting of ice-rich features such as rock glaciers or ice-rich talus slopes can be challenging. These problems are caused by considerable differences in genesis and thermal characteristics between ice-poor permafrost, occurring for example in rock walls, and ice-rich permafrost. While ice-poor permafrost shows a strong correlation of ground temperature with elevation and potential incoming solar radiation, ice-rich ground does not show such a correlation. Instead, the distribution of ice-rich ground is controlled by gravitational processes such as the relocation of ground ice by permafrost creep or by ground ice genesis from avalanche deposits or glacierets covered with talus.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} We therefore developed a mapping method which distinguishes between ice-poor and ice-rich permafrost and tested it for the entire Swiss Alps. For ice-poor ground we found a linear regression formula based on elevation and potential incoming solar radiation which predicts borehole ground temperatures at multiple depths with an accuracy higher than 0.6 gC. The zone of ice-rich permafrost was defined by modelling the deposition zones of alpine mass wasting processes. This dual approach allows the cartographic representation of permafrost-free belts, which are bounded above and below by permafrost. This enables a high quality of permafrost modelling, as is shown by the validation of our map. The dominating influence of the two rather simple connected factors, elevation (as a proxy for mean annual air temperature) and solar radiation, on the distribution of ice-poor permafrost is significant for permafrost modelling in different climate conditions and regions. Indicating temperatures of ice-poor permafrost and distinguishing between ice-poor and ice-rich permafrost on a national permafrost map provides new information for users.},

While scientific investigations of coseismic landsliding are increasingly common, there is no protocol for rapid (hours-to-days) humanitarian-facing landslide assessment, and no published recognition of what is possible and what is useful to compile immediately after the event. Drawing on the 2015 M{\textless}sub{\textgreater}w{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;7.8 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal, we consider how quickly a landslide assessment based upon manual satellite-based emergency mapping (SEM) can be realistically achieved, and review the decisions taken by analysts to ascertain the timeliness and type of useful information that can be generated. We find that, at present, many forms of landslide assessment are too slow to generate relative to the speed of a humanitarian response, despite increasingly rapid access to high-quality imagery. Importantly, the value of information on landslides evolves rapidly as a disaster response develops, so identifying the purpose, timescales, and end-users of a post-earthquake landslide assessment is essential to inform the approach taken. It is clear that discussions are needed on the form and timing of landslide assessments, and how best to present and share this information, before rather than after an earthquake strikes. In this paper, we share the lessons learned from the Gorkha earthquake, with the aim of informing the approach taken by scientists to understand the evolving landslide hazard in future events and the expectations of the humanitarian community involved in disaster response.},

abstract = {The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake that occurred in a mountainous region of China induced massive landslides and caused numerous casualties and property losses. Analyzing the disturbances on vegetation detected from the abnormal sudden drops of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within a short period can be used for the purpose of rapid landslide identification. Although much research has confirmed the necessity of high-resolution satellite images in landslides identification, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometry (MODIS) products still have their usefulness for high temporal resolution, as investigated by the authors. Using MODIS MOD09Q1 NDVI products at a temporal interval of 8 days during 2008, this letter presents a method that has been developed to identify landslide distribution and evolution patterns. First, to find the optimal threshold, the MODIS NDVI time series are analyzed in a training area by an iteration searching procedure. Second, the chosen threshold is used in a larger validation area. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results are compared to interpreted landslides using SPOT5 images with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m acquired before and after the main shock. An overall 75{\%} accuracy is achieved, and better consistency is observed for landslides extending over one MODIS pixel. The proposed method has also been applied to the Wenchuan earthquake affected areas with seismic intensity IX and greater, and the similar spatial pattern of landslides distribution is obtained when compared with results by using high-resolution images and field investigation. This technique can be applied practically for rapid landslide assessment at a relatively large region after a major earthquake or other severe disturbance events. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a method for the semi-automatic recognition and mapping of recent rainfall induced shallow landslides. The method exploits VHR panchromatic and HR multispectral satellite images, and was tested in a 9.4km2 area in Sicily, Italy, where on 1 October 2009 a high intensity rainfall event caused shallow landslides, soil erosion, and inundation. Pre-event and post-event images of the study area taken by the QuickBird satellite, and information on the location and type of landslides obtained in the field and through the interpretation of post-event aerial photographs, were used to construct and validate a set of terrain classification models. The models classify each image element (pixel) based on the probability that the pixel contains (or does not contain) a new rainfall induced landslide. To construct and validate the models, a procedure in five steps was adopted. First, the pre-event and the post-event images were pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, co-registered, and corrected for atmospheric disturbance. Next, variables describing changes between the pre-event and the post-event images attributed to landslide occurrence were selected. Next, three classification models were calibrated in a training area using different multivariate statistical techniques. The calibrated models were then applied in a validation area using the same set of independent variables, and the same statistical techniques. Lastly, combined terrain classification models were prepared for the training and the validation areas. The performances of the models were evaluated using four-fold plots and receiver operating characteristic curves. The method proved capable of detecting and mapping the new rainfall induced landslides in the study area. We expect the method to be capable of detecting analogous shallow landslides caused by similar (rainfall) or different (e.g. earthquake) triggers, provided that the event slope failures leave discernable features captured by the post-event satellite images, and that the terrain information and satellite images are of adequate quality. The proposed method can facilitate the rapid production of accurate landslide event-inventory maps, and we expect that it will improve our ability to map landslides consistently over large areas. Application of the method will advance our ability to evaluate landslide hazards, and will foster our understanding of the evolution of landscapes shaped by mass-wasting processes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Coseismic landslides pose immediate and prolonged hazards to mountainous communities, and provide a rare opportunity to study the effect of large earthquakes on erosion and sediment budgets. By mapping landslides using high-resolution satellite imagery, we find that the 25 April 2015 M w 7.8 Gorkha earthquake and aftershock sequence produced at least 25,000 landslides throughout the steep Himalayan Mountains in central Nepal. Despite early reports claiming lower than expected landslide activity, our results show that the total number, area, and volume of landslides associated with the Gorkha event are consistent with expectations, when compared to prior landslide-triggering earthquakes around the world. The extent of landsliding mimics the extent of fault rupture along the east-west trace of the Main Himalayan Thrust and increases eastward following the progression of rupture. In this event, maximum modeled Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and the steepest topographic slopes of the High Himalaya are not spatially coincident, so it is not surprising that landslide density correlates neither with PGA nor steepest slopes on their own. Instead, we find that the highest landslide density is located at the confluence of steep slopes, high mean annual precipitation, and proximity to the deepest part of the fault rupture from which 0.5–2 Hz seismic energy originated. We suggest that landslide density was determined by a combination of earthquake source characteristics, slope distributions, and the influence of precipitation on rock strength via weathering and changes in vegetation cover. Determining the relative contribution of each factor will require further modeling and better constrained seismic parameters, both of which are likely to be developed in the coming few years as post-event studies evolve. Landslide mobility, in terms of the ratio of runout distance to fall height, is comparable to small volume landslides in other settings, and landslide volume-runout scaling is consistent with compilations of data on larger slope failures. In general, the size ratios of landslide source area to full landslide area are smaller than global averages, and hillslope length seems to largely control runout distance, which we propose reflects a topographic control on landslide mobility in this setting. We find that landslide size dictates runout distance and that more than half of the landslide debris was deposited in direct connection with stream channels. Connectivity, which is defined as the spatial proximity of landslides to fluvial channels, is greatest for larger landslides in the high-relief part of the High Himalaya. Although these failures are less abundant than those at lower elevations, they may have a disproportionate impact on sediment dynamics and cascading hazards, such as landslide reactivation by monsoon rainfall and landslide dams that lead to outburst floods. The overall high fluvial connectivity of coseismic landsliding in the Gorkha event suggests coupling between the earthquake cycle and sediment/geochemical budgets of fluvial systems in the Himalaya.},

abstract = {Following a large continental earthquake, information on the spatial distribution of triggered landslides is required as quickly as possible for use in emergency response coordination. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods have the potential to overcome variability in weather conditions, which often causes delays of days or weeks when mapping landslides using optical satellite imagery. Here we test landslide classifiers based on SAR coherence, which is estimated from the similarity in phase change in time between small ensembles of pixels. We test two existing SAR-coherence-based landslide classifiers against an independent inventory of landslides triggered following the M w 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, and present and test a new method, which uses a classifier based on coherence calculated from ensembles of neighbouring pixels and coherence calculated from a more dispersed ensemble of 'sibling' pixels. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, we show that none of these three SAR-coherence-based landslide classification methods are suitable for mapping individual landslides on a pixel-by-pixel basis. However, they show potential in generating lower-resolution density maps, which are used by emergency responders following an earthquake to coordinate large-scale operations and identify priority areas. The new method we present outperforms existing methods when tested at these lower resolutions, suggesting that it may be able to provide useful and rapid information on landslide distributions following major continental earthquakes.},

abstract = {Cycles of glaciation impose mechanical stresses on underlying bedrock as glaciers advance, erode, and retreat. Fracture initiation and propagation constitute rock mass damage and act as preparatory factors for slope failures; however, the mechanics of paraglacial rock slope damage remain poorly characterized. Using conceptual numerical models closely based on the Aletsch Glacier region of Switzerland, we explore how in situ stress changes associated with fluctuating ice thickness can drive progressive rock mass failure preparing future slope instabilities. Our simulations reveal that glacial cycles as purely mechanical loading and unloading phenomena produce relatively limited new damage. However, ice fluctuations can increase the criticality of fractures in adjacent slopes, which may in turn increase the efficacy of fatigue processes. Bedrock erosion during glaciation promotes significant new damage during first deglaciation. An already weakened rock slope is more susceptible to damage from glacier loading and unloading and may fail completely. We find that damage kinematics are controlled by discontinuity geometry and the relative position of the glacier; ice advance and retreat both generate damage. We correlate model results with mapped landslides around the Great Aletsch Glacier. Our result that most damage occurs during first deglaciation agrees with the relative age of the majority of identified landslides. The kinematics and dimensions of a slope failure produced in our models are also in good agreement with characteristics of instabilities observed in the field. Our results extend simplified assumptions of glacial debuttressing, demonstrating in detail how cycles of ice loading, erosion, and unloading drive paraglacial rock slope damage.},

abstract = {Repeat-pass synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry provides the possibility of producing topographic maps and geocoded as well as radiometrically calibrated radar images. However, the usefulness of such maps and images depends on our understanding of how different types of terrain affect the radar measurements. It is essential that the scene coherence between passes is sufficient. In this paper, we derive a general system model including both radar system and scene scattering properties. The model is used to interpret measurements over a forested area where the scene coherence varies between 0.2 and 0.5. The coherence is found to be sensitive to temperature changes around 0° C but surprisingly insensitive to wind speed. The interferometric height discontinuity at the forest to open-field boundary shows good agreement with in situ tree height measurements for a dense boreal forest, but is observed to decrease for a less dense forest. This suggests the possibility of estimating bole volume from the interferometric tree height and a ground DEM. The decrease of scene coherence over a dense forest with increasing baseline is also used to estimate the effective scattering layer thickness.},

abstract = {Warming of the Earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in Asia, South America, and Africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the Global Circulation Models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate.},

Application of a state-of-the-art model to a glacier in the French Alps (Taconnaz) has provided the first evaluation of the temperature evolution of a cold hanging glacier through this century. Our observations and three-dimensional modeling of the glacier response (velocity, thickness, temperature, density, and water content) to climate change indicate that Taconnaz glacier will become temperate and potentially unstable over a large area by the end of the 21st century.

abstract = {Cold ice within a polythermal ice body controls its flow dynamics through the temperature dependence of viscosity, and affects glacier hydrology by blocking water flow paths. Lakes on the surface, linked by persistent, deeply incised meltwater streams, are hallmark features of cold ice in the ablation zone of a glacier or ice sheet. Ice radar is a convenient method to map scattering from internal water bodies present in ice at the pressure melting temperature (PMT). Consequently, lack of internal scatters is indicative of cold ice. We use a helicopter-borne 30 MHz ice radar to delineate the extent of cold ice within Grenzgletscher (Zermatt, Swiss Alps). The inferred thermal structure is validated with temperature measurements in 15 deep boreholes, showing excellent agreement. The cold ice occupies 80-90 {\%} of the total ice thickness in a 400 m wide flow band along the central flow line. Quantitative interpretation of ice radar scattering power indicates a decrease of ice water content between PMT and 0.5 K below PMT, as predicted by theory, and observed in the laboratory. The cold ice which emerges at the surface in the lower ablation zone is impermeable to water, and is thus devoid of moulins if not crevassed. The surface water from melt and rain is routed through deeply incised, persistent streams and lakes, and cryoconite holes are frequent, in stark contrast to the adjacent temperate ice from other tributaries. The cold ice thus has a strong control on glacier hydrology, but is likely to change due to continued warming. {\textcopyright}2012. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Temperature profiles from seven deep boreholes drilled at three different sites between 4240 and 4300 m above sea level in the Mont Blanc area (French Alps) have been analyzed using a heat flow model and a Bayesian inverse modeling approach. Atmospheric temperature changes over the last century were estimated by simultaneous inversion of these temperature profiles. A mean warming rate of 0.14°C/decade between 1900 and 2004 was found.

abstract = {Catastrophic mass flows (CMFs) in the glacial environment are an important geomorphic process that may pose significant hazard to communities and infrastructure in glacierized mountains. CMFs form a broad range of glacial hazards and include mass movements of glacial ice, rock avalanches, ice-rock avalanches, glacial debris flows, and outburst-generated flows. Broadly, CMFs in the glacial environment are characterized by a sudden onset, high mean velocity ({\textless}5. m/s), high mobility (i.e., long runout in relation to volume), and generally involve a mixture of earth materials, water, snow, and ice. In some cases, CMF runout may exceed 100. km from source. CMFs commonly undergo dramatic process transformation during movement in response to melting of entrained ice and snow, entrainment of additional materials along its path, river-damming effects, and incorporation or displacement of water in the periglacial environment; process complexity thus represents a challenge to quantitative hazard assessment. CMFs initiate in uninhabited glacial environments and frequently descend into denser populated areas where they have an impact on mountain communities and infrastructure. CMFs have been responsible for several notable mountain disasters since 1940, resulting in the death of {\textgreater}15,000 people worldwide. Our focus on an examination of process illuminates an assessment of CMF hazard in glacierized mountain regions and forms the basis for the development of mitigation strategies based on detection, warning, engineering techniques in source and run-out areas, and land-use controls. The precise relationship between the magnitude/frequency of CMFs and cryospheric change in the mountain glacial environment since ca. 1900 remains uncertain.},

abstract = {Aim: Asphyxia is the primary cause of death among avalanche victims. Avalanche airbags can lower mortality by directly reducing grade of burial, the single most important factor for survival. This study aims to provide an updated perspective on the effectiveness of this safety device. Methods: A retrospective analysis of avalanche accidents involving at least one airbag user between 1994 and 2012 in Austria, Canada, France, Norway, Slovakia, Switzerland and the United States. A multivariate analysis was used to calculate adjusted absolute risk reduction and estimate the effectiveness of airbags on grade of burial and mortality. A univariate analysis was used to examine causes of non-deployment. Results: Binomial linear regression models showed main effects for airbag use, avalanche size and injuries on critical burial, and for grade of burial, injuries and avalanche size on mortality. The adjusted risk of critical burial is 47{\%} with non-inflated airbags and 20{\%} with inflated airbags. The adjusted mortality is 44{\%} for critically buried victims and 3{\%} for non-critically buried victims. The adjusted absolute mortality reduction for inflated airbags is -11 percentage points (22{\%} to 11{\%}; 95{\%} confidence interval: -4 to -18 percentage points) and adjusted risk ratio is 0.51 (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.29 to 0.72). Overall non-inflation rate is 20{\%}, 60{\%} of which is attributed to deployment failure by the user. Conclusion: Although the impact on survival is smaller than previously reported, these results confirm the effectiveness of airbags. Non-deployment remains the most considerable limitation to effectiveness. Development of standardized data collection protocols is encouraged to facilitate further research. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract = {Avalanche airbags have dramatically increased in popularity over recent years and so the question has emerged concerning the influence they have on our risk judgment and behavior in ava- lanche terrain. There is widespread public opinion that avalanche airbags provide a sense of security that leads people to take higher risks. We conducted an online questionnaire, in which 387 participants judged 19 different potential avalanche slopes by avalanche risk, and willingness to ride or ski the slope. Addi- tionally, we asked about demographic data, safety equipment, use of risk management strategies and the Bremer Sensation Seeking Scale for measuring the participants predisposition for seeking novel and in- tensive sensations or experiences and their influence on judgment and behavior. While we did not find evidence for risk compensation for airbag users, we found Sensation Seeking as the strongest predictor whether respondents ski a slope or not. However, due to the setting of this study we relate our findings to a planning situation and further research is necessary to evaluate these results in real backcountry trip situations.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical investigations suggest that the rate of river incision into bedrock depends nonlinearly on sediment supply, challenging the common assumption that incision rate is simply proportional to stream power. Our measurements from laboratory abrasion mills support the hypothesis that sediment promotes erosion at low supply rates by providing tools for abrasion, but inhibits erosion at high supply rates by burying underlying bedrock beneath transient deposits. Maximum erosion rates occur at a critical level of coarse-grained sediment supply where the bedrock is only partially exposed. Fine-grained sediments provide poor abrasive tools for lowering bedrock river beds because they tend to travel in suspension. Experiments also reveal that rock resistance to fluvial erosion scales with the square of rock tensile strength. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variations in the extent of bedrock exposure provide incising rivers with a previously unrecognized degree of freedom in adjusting to changes in rock uplift rate and climate. Furthermore, we conclude that the grain size distribution of sediment supplied by hillslopes to the channel network is a fundamental control on bedrock channel gradients and topographic relief.},

abstract = {Avalanches pose a serious threat to recreational backcountry travelers in mountainous terrain. This study explores how the three main amateur user groups of avalanche terrain in western Canada (backcountry skiers, out-of-bound skiers, and snowmobile riders) balance recreational goals with safety concerns when choosing backcountry destinations under varying avalanche conditions. Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), a stated preference technique, the study first examines the strengths and weaknesses in the decision process of the three amateur groups by comparing their responses with the choice patterns of professional mountain guides. The results show that the decision-making strategies employed by the respective amateur groups vary considerably in their level of complexity and the degree to which avalanche safety considerations are incorporated. Second, we examine the effects of a decision aid that preprocesses the most crucial pieces of avalanche hazard information on the decision preferences of the amateur groups in the DCE. The results show that a relatively simple decision aid can influence the decision-making process considerably and steer users towards more avalanche hazard sensitive behaviour. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {I recently saw an old friend for the first time in many years. We had been Ph.D. students at the same time, both studying science, although in different areas. She later dropped out of graduate school, went to Harvard Law School and is now a senior lawyer for a major environmental organization. At some point, the conversation turned to why she had left graduate school. To my utter astonishment, she said it was because it made her feel stupid. After a couple of years of feeling stupid every day, she was ready to do something else. I had thought of her as one of the brightest people I knew and her subsequent career supports that view. What she said bothered me. I kept thinking about it; sometime the next day, it hit me. Science makes me feel stupid too. It's just that I've gotten used to it. So used to it, in fact, that I actively seek out new opportunities to feel stupid. I wouldn't know what to do without that feeling. I even think it's supposed to be this way. Let me explain. For almost all of us, one of the reasons that we liked science in high school and college is that we were good at it. That can't be the only reason – fascination with understanding the physical world and an emotional need to discover new things has to enter into it too. But high-school and college science means taking courses, and doing well in courses means getting the right answers on tests. If you know those answers, you do well and get to feel smart. A Ph.D., in which you have to do a research project, is a whole different thing. For me, it was a daunting task. How could I possibly frame the questions that would lead to significant discoveries; design and interpret an experiment so that the conclusions were absolutely convincing; foresee difficulties and see ways around them, or, failing that, solve them when they occurred? My Ph.D. project was somewhat interdisciplinary and, for a while, whenever I ran into a problem, I pestered the faculty in my department who were experts in the various disciplines that I needed. I remember the day when Henry Taube (who won the Nobel Prize two years later) told me he didn't know how to solve the problem I was having in his area. I was a third-year graduate student and I figured that Taube knew about 1000 times more than I did (conservative estimate). If he didn't have the answer, nobody did. That's when it hit me: nobody did. That's why it was a research problem. And being my research problem, it was up to me to solve. Once I faced that fact, I solved the problem in a couple of days. (It wasn't really very hard; I just had to try a few things.) The crucial lesson was that the scope of things I didn't know wasn't merely vast; it was, for all practical purposes, infinite. That realization, instead of being discouraging, was liberating. If our ignorance is infinite, the only possible course of action is to muddle through as best we can. I'd like to suggest that our Ph.D. programs often do students a disservice in two ways. First, I don't think students are made to understand how hard it is to do research. And how very, very hard it is to do important research. It's a lot harder than taking even very demanding courses. What makes it difficult is that research is immersion in the unknown. We just don't know what we're doing. We can't be sure whether we're asking the right question or doing the right experiment until we get the answer or the result. Admittedly, science is made harder by competition for grants and space in top journals. But apart from all of that, doing significant research is intrinsically hard and changing departmental, institutional or national policies will not succeed in lessening its intrinsic difficulty. Second, we don't do a good enough job of teaching our students how to be productively stupid – that is, if we don't feel stupid it means we're not really trying. I'm not talking about 'relative stupidity', in which the other students in the class actually read the material, think about it and ace the exam, whereas you don't. I'm also not talking about bright people who might be working in areas that don't match their talents. Science involves confronting our 'absolute stupidity'. That kind of stupidity is an existential fact, inherent in our efforts to push our way into the unknown. Preliminary and thesis exams have the right idea when the faculty committee pushes until the student starts getting the answers wrong or gives up and says, 'I don't know'. The point of the exam isn't to see if the student gets all the answers right. If they do, it's the faculty who failed the exam. The point is to identify the student's weaknesses, partly to see where they need to invest some effort and partly to see whether the student's knowledge fails at a sufficiently high level that they are ready to take on a research project. Productive stupidity means being ignorant by choice. Focusing on important questions puts us in the awkward position of being ignorant. One of the beautiful things about science is that it allows us to bumble along, getting it wrong time after time, and feel perfectly fine as long as we learn something each time. No doubt, this can be difficult for students who are accustomed to getting the answers right. No doubt, reasonable levels of confidence and emotional resilience help, but I think scientific education might do more to ease what is a very big transition: from learning what other people once discovered to making your own discoveries. The more comfortable we become with being stupid, the deeper we will wade into the unknown and the more likely we are to make big discoveries.},

A K-Ar age of 4.21 T 0.35 billion years represents a mixture of detrital and authigenic components and confirms the expected antiquity of rocks comprising the crater rim. Cosmic-ray–produced 3 He, 21 Ne, and 36 Ar yield concordant surface exposure ages of 78 T 30 million years. Surface exposure occurred mainly in the present geomorphic setting rather than during primary erosion and transport. Our observations are consistent with mudstone deposition shortly after the Gale impact or possibly in a later event of rapid erosion and deposition. The mudstone remained buried until recent exposure by wind-driven scarp retreat. Sedimentary rocks exposed by this mechanism may thus offer the best potential for organic biomarker preservation against destruction by cosmic radiation. M ultiple orbiter and rover missions have documented a rich geologic record on the surface of Mars, likely spanning almost the entire history of the planet [e.g., (1)]. However, interpretation of this record is im-peded by our limited understanding of the con-nection between the materials observed and their absolute age. Impact crater densities are the primary means for establishing a chronol-ogy for geologic features on Mars and other solar system bodies (2–4), but crater-based dating methods suffer from multiple sources of uncer-tainty that obscure both absolute and relative ages. In contrast, on Earth, isotopic dating meth-ods provide a powerful quantitative framework for defining geologic history and for identifying the rates and causes of geologic phenomena. Here, we report results of an attempt to apply in situ isotopic dating methods to Mars using the instrument suite aboard the Curiosity rover exploring Gale Crater.},

abstract = {Information about the internal structure of rock glaciers is needed to understand their reaction to ongoing climate warming. Three different geophysical techniques-shallow seismic refraction, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity tomography-were used to develop a detailed subsurface model of the Green Lake 5 rock glacier in the Colorado Front Range, USA. Below a thin zone of fine sediments and soils (0.7-1-m thickness; 0-20 k$\Omega$m and 320-370ms-1), a 1-3-m thick zone with low p-wave velocities (790-820ms-1) and high electrical resistivity (20-100 k$\Omega$m) is interpreted as the ice-free, blocky active layer with large void spaces. The data corroborate strong reflections of the GPR signals which travel at this depth at 0.11mns-1. A third layer that extends from depths of 1-3m to about 5m is characterised by lower electric resistivities (5-20 k$\Omega$m) and has lower electromagnetic wave velocities (0.65mns-1), representing unfrozen, finer and wetter sediments. At around 5-m depth, the measured physical parameters change drastically (vp=3200-3300ms-1, 50-150 k$\Omega$m, vGPR=0.15mns-1), showing an ice-rich permafrost zone above the bedrock. This model of the internal structure was used to evaluate an existing hydrological flowpath model based on the hydrochemical properties of water outflow from the rock glacier. {\textcopyright} 2011 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2013 Gebr{\"{u}}der Borntraeger Verlagsbuchhandlung, Stuttgart, Germany. Melting mountain permafrost is reported from alpine areas around the world as a direct consequence of rising air temperatures over the past decades. However, alpine sites that offer sufficient older data to compare with recent conditions are rare. The study site Niwot Ridge, situated at {\~{}} 3600 m a.s.l. in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, Colorado, USA, offers permafrost distribution data from the early 1970s. We used four different approaches to evaluate and compare the old data with recent conditions and to discuss consequences in how the old data should be considered. (i) Air photographs and survey stakes were used to compare modern surface conditions of a solifluction lobe with those in the past. Despite high resolution of the air photographs (0.3 m), the error of position after geo-rectification was higher (± 1.0 m) than average displacement rates of gelifluction lobes (10 mm∗a-1), rendering this approach unsuitable. Replication of a 1963 -1967 study of soil movement from 2006 - 2009 yielded average movement rates of 11.4 mm∗a-1 compared to 9.4 mm∗a-1 in the 1960s. (ii) Temperature profiles of a three-year survey (2007- 2009) to depths of 7 m were compared with data from the 1970s from the same site. Modern temperature profiles document a complex annual curve that includes several weeks of unfrozen conditions, this finding is in contrast with the permafrost conditions reported from the 1970s. (iii) Electric resistivity profiles on a gelifluction lobe, surveyed in different seasons during the year, show the freezing front down to 2 m depth during the early winter, the melting process during spring conditions and the complete melt of all ice lenses during the summer months. Geophysical results corroborate data from nearby temperature loggers and were used to extend the survey to other areas on Niwot Ridge. (iv) A simple 1 D-heat flow model was driven by the annual temperature variations of 1972 and 2008, resulting in several weeks of unfrozen conditions at various depths but with temperatures close to freezing during the 1970s. Our study documents that at present, on south facing slopes, permafrost neither exists at 2 m depth on wet sites nor at 4 m depth on dry sites as suggested during the 1970s. Our modeling approach further suggests that, except on wet gelifluction lobes, it is likely that permafrost was not present at 3600 m during 1970, if so, permafrost degradation on south facing slopes on Niwot Ridge was not driven by recent climate change. However, north-facing slopes do cover permafrost, and certainly did in the 1970s, they are most probably affected by climate warming as already documented by a changing hydro-chemical signal in nearby streams.},

abstract = {This paper describes recent exceptional slope failures in high-mountain, glacial environments: the 2002 Kolka-Karmadon rock-ice avalanche in the Caucasus, a series of ice-rock avalanches on Iliamna Volcano, Alaska, the 2005 Mt. Steller rock-ice avalanche in Alaska, and ice and rock avalanches at Monte Rosa, Italy in 2005 and 2007. Deposit volumes range from 106 to 108 m3 and include rock, ice and snow. Here we focus on thermal aspects of these failures reflecting the involvement of glacier ice and permafrost at all sites, suggesting that thermal perturbations likely contributed to the slope failures. We use surface and troposphere air temperatures, near-surface rock temperatures, satellite thermal data, and recent 2D and 3D thermal modeling studies to document thermal conditions at the landslide sites. We distinguish between thermal perturbations of volcanic-geothermal and climatic origin, and thermal perturbations related to glacier-permafrost interaction. The data and analysis support the view that recent, current and future climatic change increases the likelihood of large slope failures in steep glacierized and permafrost terrain. However, some important aspects of these settings such as the geology and tectonic environment remain poorly understood, making the identification of future sites of large slope instabilities difficult. In view of the potentially large natural disasters that can be caused by such slope failures, improved data and understanding are needed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lu2012,
abstract = {Slope-stability analyses are mostly conducted by identifying or assuming a potential failure surface and assessing the factor of safety (FS) of that surface. This approach of assigning a single FS to a potentially unstable slope provides little insight on where the failure initiates or the ultimate geometry and location of a landslide rupture surface. We describe a method to quantify a scalar field of FS based on the concept of the Coulomb stress and the shift in the state of stress toward failure that results from rainfall infiltration. The FS at each point within a hillslope is called the local factor of safety (LFS) and is defined as the ratio of the Coulomb stress at the current state of stress to the Coulomb stress of the potential failure state under the Mohr-Coulomb criterion. Comparative assessment with limit-equilibrium and hybrid finite element limit-equilibrium methods show that the proposed LFS is consistent with these approaches and yields additional insight into the geometry and location of the potential failure surface and how instability may initiate and evolve with changes in pore water conditions. Quantitative assessments applying the new LFS field method to slopes under infiltration conditions demonstrate that the LFS has the potential to overcome several major limitations in the classical FS methodologies such as the shape of the failure surface and the inherent underestimation of slope instability. Comparison with infinite-slope methods, including a recent extension to variably saturated conditions, shows further enhancement in assessing shallow landslide occurrence using the LFS methodology. Although we use only a linear elastic solution for the state of stress with no post-failure analysis that require more sophisticated elastoplastic or other theories, the LFS provides a new means to quantify the potential instability zones in hillslopes under variably saturated conditions using stress-field based methods.},

@article{Nuth2011,
abstract = {Here are an increasing number of digital elevation models (DEMs) available worldwide for deriving elevation differences over time, including vertical changes on glaciers. Most of these DEMs are heavily post-processed or merged, so that physical error modelling becomes difficult and statistical error modelling is required instead. We propose a three-step methodological framework for assessing and correcting DEMs to quantify glacier elevation changes: (i) remove DEM shifts, (ii) check for elevation-dependent biases, and (iii) check for higher-order, sensor-specific biases. A simple, analytic and robust method to co-register elevation data is presented in regions where stable terrain is either plentiful (case study New Zealand) or limited (case study Svalbard). The method is demonstrated using the three global elevation data sets available to date, SRTM, ICESat and the ASTER GDEM, and with automatically generated DEMs from satellite stereo instruments of ASTER and SPOT5-HRS. After 3-D co-registration, significant biases related to elevation were found in some of the stereoscopic DEMs. Biases related to the satellite acquisition geometry (along/cross track) were detected at two frequencies in the automatically generated ASTER DEMs. The higher frequency bias seems to be related to satellite jitter, most apparent in the back-looking pass of the satellite. The origins of the more significant lower frequency bias is uncertain. ICESat-derived elevations are found to be the most consistent globally available elevation data set available so far. Before performing regional-scale glacier elevation change studies or mosaicking DEMs from multiple individual tiles (e.g. ASTER GDEM), we recommend to co-register all elevation data to ICESat as a global vertical reference system.},

abstract = {The vortex equation is often used to estimate the front velocity of debris flows using the lateral slope of the flow surface through a channel bend of a given radius. Here we report on laboratory experiments evaluating the application of the vortex equation to channelized debris flows. Systematic laboratory experiments were conducted ina8mlong laboratory flume with a roughened bed, semi-circular cross section (top width 17 cm), and two different bend radii (1.0 and 1.5 m) with a common bend angle of 60°, and two channel inclinations (15° and 20°). Four sediment mixtures were used with systematic variations in the amount of fine sediment. In the experiments, 12 kg of water-saturated debris were released in a dam-break fashion, and multiple experiments were conducted to verify the repeatability for a given sediment mixture. Data are available for 69 experimental releases at a channel inclination of 20° and 16 releases at an inclination of 15°. Flow velocity was determined with high-speed video, and flow depth and the lateral inclination of the flow surface (superelevation) were measured using laser sensors. In general, the results from an individual sediment mixture are repeatable. We found that the channel slope as well as centerline radius have a significant influence on the correction factor k used in the vortex equation. Relatively coarse-grained sediment mixtures have larger superelevation angles than finer-grained mixtures.Wefound a statistically significant relation between the correction factor and Froude number. Correction factors of 1 {\textless}k {\textless}5 were found for supercritical flow conditions. However, for subcritical flow conditions the correction factor shows a larger value as a function of the Froude number, which leads to an adaption of the forced vortex formula considering active and passive earth pressures. Finally, based on our experimental results, we present a forced vortex equation for debris-flow velocity estimation without a correction factor.},

abstract = {Global loss of life from landslides is poorly quantifi ed. A global data set of fatalities from nonseismically triggered landslides that resulted in loss of life between A.D. 2004 and 2010 permits for the fi rst time proper quantifi cation of impacts and spatial distributions. In total, 2620 fatal landslides were recorded worldwide during the 7 yr period of the study, causing a total of 32,322 recorded fatalities. These total numbers of landslides and victims are an order of magnitude greater than other data sets have indicated, but analysis of the data suggests that it may still slightly underestimate the true human costs. The majority of human losses occur in Asia, especially along the Himalayan Arc and in China. This geographical concentration dominates the annual landslide cycle, which peaks in the Northern Hemisphere summer months. Finally, numbers of fatalities per event show a fat-tailed power law distribution, with the density of landslides being moderately correlated with the population density on a national basis.},

@article{Nobakht2014,
abstract = {Mountain chains of Central Asia host a large number of glaciated areas that provide critical water supplies to the semi-arid populated foothills and lowlands of this region. Spatio-temporal variations of glacier flows are a key indicator of the impact of climate change on water resources as the glaciers react sensitively to climate. Satellite remote sensing using optical imagery is an efficient method for studying ice-velocity fields on mountain glaciers. In this study, temporal and spatial changes in surface velocity associated with the Inylchek glacier in Kyrgyzstan are investigated. We present a detailed map for the kinematics of the Inylchek glacier obtained by cross-correlation analysis of Landsat images, acquired between 2000 and 2011, and a set of ASTER images covering the time period between 2001 and 2007. Our results indicate a high-velocity region in the elevated part of the glacier, moving up to a rate of about 0.5 m/day. Time series analysis of optical data reveals some annual variations in the mean surface velocity of the Inylchek during 2000–2011. In particular, our findings suggest an opposite trend between periods of the northward glacial flow in Proletarskyi and Zvezdochka glacier, and the rate of westward motion observed for the main stream of the Inylchek.},

Power spectra of interferograms are typically the sum of a narrow-band component combined with broad-band noise.

The performance of the filter is demonstrated with SAR data from the ERS satellites over the Jakobshavns glacier of Greenland.},

abstract = {The mechanisms that control climate-dependent rockfall from permafrost mountain slopes are currently poorly understood. In this study, we present the results of an extensive rock slope monitoring campaign at the Matterhorn (Switzerland) with a wireless sensor network. A negative dependency of cleft expansion relative to temperature was observed at all clefts for the dominant part of the year. At many clefts this process is interrupted by a period with increased opening and shearing activity in the summer months. More specific, this period lasts from sustained melting within the cleft to the first freezing in autumn. Based on these empirical findings we identify two distinct process regimes governing the cleft motion observed. Combining current theories with laboratory evidence on rock slope movement and stability, we postulate that (1) the negative temperature-dependency is caused by thermomechanical forcing and is reinforced by cryogenic processes during the freezing period and, (2) the enhanced movement in summer originates from a hydro-thermally induced strength reduction in clefts containing perennial ice. It can be assumed that the irreversible part of the process described in (1) slowly modifies the geometric settings and cleft characteristics of permafrost rock slopes in the long term. The thawing related processes (2) can affect stability within hours or weeks. Such short-term stability minima may activate rock masses subject to the slow changes and lead to acceleration and failure.},

@article{Huggel2008a,
abstract = {On 25 September 2008, seismometers operated by the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) registered strong ground shaking. On the basis of previous experience with such large seismic signals, AVO personnel were able to rapidly identify the seismic event as an avalanche. Two days later, an AVO overflight of Iliamna volcano, near Alaskas Cook Inlet, confirmed that a massive chunk of glacial ice and rock had broken free from its position on the upper flanks of the volcano, generating a massive avalanche that could have buried an entire town had it occurred in a more populated area. Rapidly moving rock, ice, or debris avalanches, such as the one that occurred on Iliamna, can be highly destructive and deadly. Similar events have caused the deaths of hundreds to thousands of people Keefer and Larsen, 2007. In general, avalanches that move more than 1 million cubic meters of material are rare. However, a remarkable series of large avalanches recently occurred in Alaska and the Caucasus, providing a new opportunity to better understand this type of hazard. All events initiated in steep mountain slopes, involved rock and significant amounts of ice, and traveled for 10 35 kilometers. Combined geophysical methods can be applied to investigate the failure and propagation of large avalanches. We primarily use seismic signals, coupled with ground-based and remote temperature data. In temperaturesensitive glacier and permafrost environments, thermal perturbations are highly relevant because changes from frozen to liquid water can fundamentally affect slope stability. In the cases presented here, geophysical methods support the analysis of possible thermal perturbations due to volcanic activity and climate change. Improved detection and analysis methods are particularly important in the context of ongoing and likely accelerating climate change, where related hazards are becoming increasingly problematic.},

@article{Gruber2007,
abstract = {Permafrost in steep bedrock is abundant in many cold-mountain areas, and its degradation can cause slope instability that is unexpected and unprecedented in location, magnitude, frequency, and timing. These phenomena bear consequences for the understanding of landscape evolution, natural hazards, and the safe and sustainable operation of high-mountain infrastructure. Permafrost in steep bedrock is an emerging field of research. Knowledge of rock temperatures, ice content, mechanisms of degradation, and the processes that link warming and destabilization is often fragmental. In this article we provide a review and discussion of existing literature and pinpoint important questions. Ice-filled joints are common in bedrock permafrost and possibly actively widened by ice segregation. Broad evidence of destabilization by warming permafrost exists despite problems of attributing individual events to this phenomenon with certainty. Convex topography such as ridges, spurs, and peaks is often subject to faster and deeper thaw than other areas. Permafrost degradation in steep bedrock can be strongly affected by percolating water in fractures. This degradation by advection is difficult to predict and can lead to quick and deep development of thaw corridors along fractures in permafrost and potentially destabilize much greater volumes of rock than conduction would. Although most research on steep bedrock permafrost originates from the Alps, it will likely gain importance in other geographic regions with mountain permafrost.},

Boeckli (lorenz.boeckligeo.uzh.ch) Published by Copernicus Publications on behalf of the European Geosciences Union. 1419 Abstract Permafrost distribution modeling in densely populated mountain regions is an impor- tant task to support the construction of infrastructure and for the assessment of climate change effects on permafrost and related natural systems. In order to analyze per- 5 mafrost distribution and evolution on an Alpine-wide scale, one consistent model for the entire domain is needed. We present a statistical permafrost model for the entire Alps based on rock glacier inventories and rock surface temperatures. Starting from an integrated model frame- work, two different sub-models were developed, one for debris covered areas (debris 10 model) and one for steep rock faces (rock model). For the debris model a generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) was used to predict the probability of a rock glacier being intact as opposed to relict. The model is based on the explanatory variables mean annual air temperature (MAAT), potential incoming solar radiation (PISR) and the mean annual sum of precipitation (PRECIP), and achieves an excellent discrimi- 15 nation (area under the receiver-operating characteristic, AUROC=0.91). Surprisingly, the probability of a rock glacier being intact is positively associated with increasing PRECIP for given MAAT and PISR conditions. The rock model was calibrated with mean annual rock surface temperatures (MARST) and is based on MAAT and PISR. The linear regression achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.6 C. The final 20 model combines the two sub-models and accounts for the different scales used for model calibration. Further steps to transfer this model into a map-based product are outlined.},

@article{Crozier2010,
abstract = {Increased landslide activity is commonly listed as an expected impact of human-induced climate change. This paper examines the theoretical and empirical bases for this assertion. It identifies the mechanisms by which climate can induce landsliding and examines the manner in which these mechanisms may respond to changes in a range of climatic parameters. It is argued that inherent limiting stability factors, which vary with different terrain conditions and landslide types, ultimately govern the nature of response to changing climate. Several modelling approaches are evaluated on the basis of their potential to predict landslide response to climate projections. Given reliable input data of appropriate form and resolution, the existing slope stability, hydrological, and statistical models are for the most part capable of yielding useful prognoses on occurrence, reactivation, magnitude and frequency of landsliding. While there is a strong theoretical basis for increased landslide activity as a result of predicted climate change, there remains a high level of uncertainty resulting from the margins of error inherent in scenario-driven global climate predictions, and the lack of sufficient spatial resolution of currently available downscaled projections. Examples from New Zealand are used to illustrate the extent to which changes resulting from human activity have affected slope stability. Changes resulting from human activity are seen as a factor of equal, if not greater, importance than climate change in affecting the temporal and spatial occurrence of landslides. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

It is likely related to the fast thermal reaction of the subsurface of steep rock slopes and a corresponding destabilization of ice-filled discontinuities. This suggests that rockfall may be a direct and unexpectedly fast impact of climate change. Based upon our measurements in Alpine rock faces, we present model simulations illustrating the distribution and degradation of permafrost where the summer of 2003 has resulted in extreme thaw. We argue that hotter summers predicted by climate models for the coming decades will result in reduced stability of many alpine rock walls.},

abstract = {Knowledge of landslide kinematics is a basic requirement for understanding landsliding mechanisms. Traditional approaches for characterizing landslide kinematics often require centimeters- meters of landslide movement to be effective, are labor intensive, costly, time consuming, and can be dangerous or impossible on inaccessible landslides. We tested the IBIS-L, which is a ground-based, interferometric, synthetic aperture radar, to determine whether it could rapidly acquire kinematic data for the complex, 3.9-km-long Slumgullion landslide located in Colorado, USA. The landslide moves persistently at rates of ∼cm/d. Displacement data acquired by the IBIS-L, apart from some points located in vegetated areas, compared favorably with measurements made using GPS surveys and in-situ instrumentation. Within one day of surveying, kinematic elements comprising the landslide were clearly evident and correlated well with results from previous field mapping and analyses of aerial photographs. Preliminary analyses of results provide insight into characteristics of the landslide.},

A preliminary slope stability analysis of the 2007 Mount Steele rock and ice avalanche was also undertaken. The orientation of very high persistence ({\textgreater}20 m long) structural planes (e.g. faults, joints and bedding) within bedrock in the source zone was obtained using an airborne-LiDAR digital elevation model and the software COLTOP-3D. Using these discontinuity orientation measurements, kinematic, surface wedge and simple three-dimensional distinct element slope stability analyses were performed. 1mbrideau@sfu.ca},

abstract = {Controls on the global distribution of surge-type glaciers hold the keys to a better understanding of surge mechanisms. We investigate correlations between the distribution of surge-type glaciers and climatic and glacier geometry variables, using a new global geodatabase of 2317 surge-type glaciers. The highest densities of surge-type glaciers occur within an optimal climatic envelope bounded by temperature and precipitation thresholds. Across all regions with both surge-type and normal glaciers, the former are larger, especially at the cold, dry end of the climatic spectrum. A species distribution model, Maxent, accurately predicts the major clusters of surge-type glaciers using a series of climatic and glacier geometry variables, but under-predicts clusters found outside the climatically optimal surge zone. We interpret the results in terms of a new enthalpy cycle model. Steady states require a balance between enthalpy gains generated by the balance flux and losses via heat conduction and meltwater discharge. This condition can be most easily satisfied in cold, dry environments (thin, low-flux glaciers, efficient conductive heat losses) and warm, humid environments (high meltwater discharges). Intermediate conditions correspond to the optimal surge zone, where neither heat conduction nor runoff can effectively discharge enthalpy gains, and dynamic cycling can result.},

abstract = {Runup of debris flows against obstacles in their paths is a complex process that involves profound flow deceleration and redirection. We investigate the dynamics and predictability of runup by comparing results from large-scale laboratory experiments, four simple analytical models, and a depth-integrated numerical model (D-Claw). The experiments and numerical simulations reveal the important influence of unsteady, multidimensional flow on runup, and the analytical models highlight key aspects of the underlying physics. Runup against a vertical barrier normal to the flow path is dominated by rapid development of a shock, or jump in flow height, associated with abrupt deceleration of the flow front. By contrast, runup on sloping obstacles is initially dominated by a smooth flux of mass and momentum from the flow body to the flow front, which precedes shock development and commonly increases the runup height. D-Claw simulations that account for the emergence of shocks show that predicted runup heights vary systematically with the adverse slope angle and also with the Froude number and degree of liquefaction (or effective basal friction) of incoming flows. They additionally clarify the strengths and limitations of simplified analytical models. Numerical simulations based on a priori knowledge of the evolving dynamics of incoming flows yield quite accurate runup predictions. Less predictive accuracy is attained in ab initio simulations that compute runup based solely on knowledge of static debris properties in a distant debris flow source area. Nevertheless, the paucity of inputs required in ab initio simulations enhances their prospective value in runup forecasting.},

abstract = {Constraints on soil moisture can guide agricultural practices, act as input into weather, flooding and climate models and inform water resource policies. Space-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations provide near-global coverage, even in the presence of clouds, of proxies for soil moisture derived from the amplitude and phase content of radar imagery. We describe results from a 1.5 year-long InSAR time series spanning the March, 2015 extreme precipitation event in the hyperarid Atacama desert of Chile, constraining the immediate increase in soil moisture and drying out over the following months, as well as the response to a later, smaller precipitation event. The inferred temporal evolution of soil moisture is remarkably consistent between independent, overlapping SAR tracks covering a region {\~{}}100 km in extent. The unusually large rain event, combined with the extensive spatial and temporal coverage of the SAR dataset, present an unprecedented opportunity to image the time-evolution of soil characteristics over different surface types. Constraints on the timescale of shallow water storage after precipitation events are increasingly valuable as global water resources continue to be stretched to their limits and communities continue to develop in flood-prone areas.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to making aerial photographic measurements uses analog or analytic photogrammetric equipment. We have developed a digital method for making measurements from aerial photographs which uses geographic information system (GIS) software, and primarily DOS-based personal computers. This method, which is based on the concept that a direct visual comparison can be made between images derived from two sets of aerial photographs taken at different times, was applied to the surface of the active portion of the Slumgullion earthflow in Colorado to determine horizontal displacement vectors from the movements of visually identifiable objects, such as trees and large rocks. Using this method, more of the slide surface can be mapped in a shorter period of time than using the standard photogrammetric approach. More than 800 horizontal displacement vectors were determined on the active earthflow surface using images produced by our digital photogrammetric technique and 1985 (1:12,000-scale) and 1990 (1:6,000-scale) aerial photographs. The resulting displacement field shows, with a 2-m measurement error (??? 10{\%}), that the fastest moving portion of the landslide underwent 15-29 m of horizontal displacement between 1985 and 1990.

abstract = {The objective of this study is the production of an Alpine Permafrost Index Map (APIM) covering the entire European Alps. A unified statistical model that is based on Alpine-wide permafrost observations is used for debris and bedrock surfaces across the entire Alps. The explanatory variables of the model are mean annual air temperatures, potential incoming solar radiation and precipitation. Offset terms were applied to make model predictions for topographic and geomorphic conditions that differ from the terrain features used for model fitting. These offsets are based on literature review and involve some degree of subjective choice during model building. The assessment of the APIM is challenging because limited independent test data are available for comparison and these observations represent point information in a spatially highly variable topography. The APIM provides an index that describes the spatial distribution of permafrost and comes together with an interpretation key that helps to assess map uncertainties and to relate map contents to their actual expression in the terrain. The map can be used as a first resource to estimate permafrost conditions at any given location in the European Alps in a variety of contexts such as research and spatial planning. Results show that Switzerland likely is the country with the largest permafrost area in the Alps, followed by Italy, Austria, France and Germany. Slovenia and Liechtenstein may have marginal permafrost areas. In all countries the permafrost area is expected to be larger than the glacier-covered area.},

abstract = {Since 1994, at least six major (volume {\textgreater}106 m3) ice and rock avalanches have occurred on Iliamna volcano, Alaska, USA. Each of the avalanches was preceded by up to 2 hours of seismicity believed to represent the initial stages of failure. Each seismic sequence begins with a series of repeating earthquakes thought to represent slip on an ice-rock interface, or between layers of ice. This stage is followed by a prolonged period of continuous ground-shaking that reflects constant slip accommodated by deformation at the glacier base. Finally the glacier fails in a large avalanche. Some of the events appear to have entrained large amounts of rock, while others comprise mostly snow and ice. Several avalanches initiated from the same source region, suggesting that this part of the volcano is particularly susceptible to failure, possibly due to the presence of nearby fumaroles. Although thermal conditions at the time of failure are not well constrained, it is likely that geothermal energy causes melting at the glacier base, promoting slip and culminating in failure. The frequent nature and predictable failure sequence of Iliamna avalanches makes the volcano an excellent laboratory for the study of ice avalanches. The prolonged nature of the seismic signal suggests that warning may one day be given for similar events occurring in populated regions.},

abstract = {Abstract Soils with mountain permafrost occupy 3.5 million km2 worldwide, with 70{\%} in cen- tral Asia. High-mountain environments have “warm” permafrost, with surface permafrost temperatures of –0.5 to –2 °C and deep active layers (2 to 8 m). From a global database of 41 sites and 312 pedons, alpine soils with permafrost are strongly acid (pH = 5.0 to 5.5), have intermediate cation-exchange capacities (20 to 25 cmolc /kg) and base satura- tion (44{\%} to 85{\%}), and commonly have an isotic mineral class. Soil organic carbon is concentrated in the upper 30 to 40 cm, with profile density averaging 15.2 ± 1.3 kg m–2 (range = {\textless}1.0 to 88.3 kg m–2 ), which is comparable to temperate grasslands (13 kg m–2 ) but substantially less than moist arctic tundra (32 kg m–2 ). Mountain soils with permafrost contain 66.3 Pg of soil organic carbon (SOC), which constitutes 4.5{\%} of the global pool. In contrast, the SOC pool in the Arctic is 496 Pg (33{\%} of the global pool). Alpine soils with deep active layers contrast strongly with high-latitude soils in areas of continuous permafrost. Permafrost in the upper 2 m induces cryoturbation in the profile, acts as a barrier to water movement, and generates cooler temperatures resulting in greater SOC levels. High-elevation and high-latitude soils are experiencing warming of air temperature and permafrost and a thickening of the active layer.},

abstract = {A slope 120 m wide and 100 m high collapsed including the roadbed of a national highway of Route 168 at Ohto, Nara, Japan on August 10, 2004. The precursory phenomena of abnormal features were found as cracks growing on the road-side slope 7 months before the catastrophe. The movements of the slope were monitored by extensometers. The data of the extensometers showed that creep mode turned from the secondary into the tertiary due to the heavy rainstorm of Typhoon Namtheun. The slide claimed no victims because the highway was closed 43 h before the catastrophe, anticipating a possible hazard when the creep velocity reached 4 mm/2 h. Comparison of rupture time predictions suggested that precision of the prediction using the reciprocal of creep velocity is higher than that by tertiary creep analysis, although leaving a problem that the prediction of the time zone of failure erred on the dangerous side. The slide generated ground vibration which was observed by seismometers deployed around the slide. Duration of the seismic signals corresponded well with the slide motion deciphered from video records. We found the fact that the seismic energy radiation from a landslide consisted of four stages. This had not been reported in any previous study, and may be important in understanding the dynamics of a rock-slide avalanche. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

We combine interpretation of aerial photographs and information on surface displacement from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry for mapping landslides and intensity classification. Sketch maps of landslides distinguished by typology and depth, including geomorphological features, are compiled by stereoscopic photo-interpretation. Results achieved with differential SAR interferometry (InSAR) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) are used to estimate the state of activity of landslides around villages and in sparsely vegetated areas with numerous exposed rocks. For validation and possible extension of the inventory around vegetated areas, where InSAR and PSI failed to retrieve displacement information, traditional monitoring data such as topographic measurements and GPS are considered. Our results, covering extensive areas, are a valuable contribution towards the analysis of landslide hazards in areas where traditional monitoring techniques are sparse or unavailable. In this contribution we discuss our methodology for a study area around the deep-seated landslide in Osco in southern Switzerland.},

@article{Coe2016,
abstract = {On 25 May 2014, a rain-on-snow-induced rock avalanche occurred in the West Salt Creek valley on the northern flank of Grand Mesa in western Colorado (United States). The avalanche mobilized from a preexisting rock slide in the Green River Formation and traveled 4.6 km down the confined valley, killing three people. The avalanche was rare for the contiguous United States because of its large size (54.5 Mm super(3)) and high mobility (height/length = 0.14). To understand the avalanche failure sequence, mechanisms, and mobility, we conducted a forensic analysis using large-scale (1:1000) structural mapping and seismic data. We used high-resolution, unmanned aircraft system imagery as a base for field mapping, and analyzed seismic data from 22 broadband stations (distances {\textless}656 km from the rock-slide source area) and one short-period network. We inverted broadband data to derive a time series of forces that the avalanche exerted on the earth and tracked these forces using curves in the avalanche path. Our results revealed that the rock avalanche was a cascade of landslide events, rather than a single massive failure. The sequence began with an early morning landslide/debris flow that started similar to 10 h before the main avalanche. The main avalanche lasted similar to 3.5 min and traveled at average velocities ranging from 15 to 36 m/s. For at least two hours after the avalanche ceased movement, a central, hummock-rich core continued to move slowly. Since 25 May 2014, numerous shallow landslides, rock slides, and rock falls have created new structures and modified avalanche topography. Mobility of the main avalanche and central core was likely enhanced by valley floor material that liquefied from undrained loading by the overriding avalanche. Although the base was likely at least partially liquefied, our mapping indicates that the overriding avalanche internally deformed predominantly by sliding along discrete shear surfaces in material that was nearly dry and had substantial frictional strength. These results indicate that the West Salt Creek avalanche, and probably other long-traveled avalanches, could be modeled as two layers: a thin, liquefied basal layer, and a thicker and stronger overriding layer.},

abstract = {Here we present the first systematic measurements of European mountain permafrost temperatures from a latitudinal transect of six boreholes extending from the Alps, through Scandinavia to Svalbard. Boreholes were drilled in bedrock to depths of at least 100 m between May 1998 and September 2000. Geothermal profiles provide evidence for regional-scale secular warming, since all are nonlinear, with near-surface warm-side temperature deviations from the deeper thermal gradient. Topographic effects lead to variability between Alpine sites. First approximation estimates, based on curvature within the borehole thermal profiles, indicate a maximum ground surface warming of + 1??C in Svalbard, considered to relate to thermal changes in the last 100 years. In addition, a 15-year time series of thermal data from the 58-m-deep Murt??l-Corvatsch permafrost borehole in Switzerland, drilled in creeping frozen ice-rich rock debris, shows an overall warming trend, but with high-amplitude interannual fluctuations that reflect early winter snow cover more strongly than air temperatures. Thus interpretation of the deeper borehole thermal histories must clearly take account of the potential effects of changing snow cover in addition to atmospheric temperatures. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Many assessments of glacial sediment yield rely solely on measurements of fine-grained suspended sediment. We show that suspended sediment contributes {\textless}20{\%} of the total clastic sediment discharge into Iceberg Lake, an Alaskan proglacial lake. Drainage of this lake in 1999 exposed outcrops of varved lacustrine sediment that record suspended sediment deposition. Since a Little Ice Age highstand two centuries ago, lake level has dropped in four abrupt spillway-controlled events that are recorded stratigraphically as transient increases in the basinwide deposition of unusually fine grained sediments. Varve counting constrains ages of these events and, hence, of each abandoned shoreline and associated delta. Volumes of deltaic and lake-floor sediments constrain specific yields from four multidecadal intervals between A.D. 1825 and 1999. Total yield ranges from 3.8 to 4.9 × 103 t{\textperiodcentered}km−2{\textperiodcentered}yr−1, and most of the sediment (81{\%}–86{\%}) is sand and gravel now in the deltas. A range of evidence suggests that sediment yield faithfully records upstream sediment production in this small (66 km2) and heavily glacierized basin, implying an effective subglacial erosion rate of 1.6 mm/yr. These data show that estimates of total yield based upon suspended sediment alone are subject to large errors and suggest that quarrying accounts for a large fraction of the glacial erosion in this system.},

abstract = {Avalanching glacier instabilities are gravity-driven rupture phenomena that might cause major disasters, especially when they are at the origin of a chain of processes. Reliably forecasting such events combined with a timely evacuation of endangered inhabited areas often constitute the most efficient action. Recently, considerable efforts in monitoring, analyzing, and modeling such phenomena have led to significant advances in destabilization process understanding, improving early warning perspectives. The purpose of this paper is to review the recent progress in this domain. Three different types of instabilities can be identified depending on the thermal properties of the ice/bed interface. If cold (1), the maturation of the rupture is associated with a typical time evolution of surface velocities and passive seismic activity. A prediction of the final break off is possible using these precursory signs. For the two other types, water plays a key role in the development of the instability. If the ice/bed interface is partly temperate (2), the presence of meltwater may reduce the basal resistance, which promotes the instability. No clear and easily detectable precursory signs are known in this case, and the only way to infer any potential instability is to monitor the temporal evolution of the thermal regime. The last type of instability (3) concerns steep temperate glacier tongues switching for several days/weeks during the melting season into a so-called “active phase” followed in rare cases by a major break-off event. Although the prediction of such events is still far from being achievable, critical conditions promoting the final instability can be identified.},

abstract = {Permafrost distribution, or ground that remains frozen for at least 2 years, has been modeled using a combination of Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) variables, and land cover in alpine regions of the world. In the Front Range, however, no such empirical models have been developed, and field data are restricted in spatial extent, but rock glaciers are in abundance. Here, I present a probabilistic logistic regression model that is based on topoclimatic information (elevation and aspect) for rock glaciers derived from U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 10-m DEMs. Classes of land cover, obtained from an Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image classification, were assigned weights and were then multiplied by the regression results to refine estimates. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated by comparing mean probability scores with rock glacier activity categories, Mean Annual Air Temperature (MAAT) from climatic stations on Niwot Ridge, and Bottom Temperature of winter Snow (BTS) measurements, while a Monte Carlo simulation was used to detect uncertainty associated with the original DEM. Permafrost scores {\textgreater}50{\%} covered about 8.9{\%} (242 km2 of the study area (2722 km2) with the highest scores clustered around Longs and Rowe Peaks. Permafrost locations showed a strong correlation with rock glacier activity classes, the -1.0 ??C MAAT isotherm, and BTS measurements less than -3.0 ??C. The uncertainty analysis revealed that slight global differences exist between the original and error prone DEM; however, local variations in aspect caused the most uncertainty. These results indicate that the model accurately represents regional distribution of permafrost. Therefore, topoclimatic information from rock glaciers and land cover, when combined with an uncertainty analysis, can effectively be used to map the occurrence of Front Range permafrost, providing an imperative tool for cartographers, planners, and geocryologists. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The Upper Durance catchment is an area prone to rock-slope failures. Such failures reflect the combination of high relief, litho-structural controls and paraglacial stress release. The aim of this study is to determine the role of deglacial unloading and resulting paraglacial stress release in conditioning or triggering slope failure. Former dimensions of the Durance glacier are reconstructed, then combined with Digital Elevation Model data in a raster Geographic Information System to quantify the spatial pattern of stresses associated with glacial loading at the Last Glacial Maximum. Preliminary calculations suggest that major rock falls and rock avalanches are associated with areas subject to the highest decompression stresses. Focus on two case studies allows the consequences of paraglacial stress release on slope instability to be evaluated. Description of slope failure runout deposits allows reconstruction of the nature of slope failure. Surface exposure dates based on concentration of cosmogenic 10Be allows the timing of both deglaciation and that of post-glacial rock-slope failures to be established. It is shown that rock-slope failures are concentrated on lower valley-side slopes within the area occupied by ice at the Last Glacial Maximum, and that their locations coincide with zones of inferred high glacial loading stress, consistent with interpretation of both bedrock disruption and large-scale rock-slope failures as paraglacial phenomena induced by stress release following deglaciation. Timing of initial rock avalanche runout deposition at one site is consistent with this conclusion, though later instability episodes at the same site may have occurred independent of the influence of paraglacial stress release. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The seasonal storage of thermal energy in the ground is a useful application able to provide H{\&}C and DHW demand of commercial or residential buildings. Several examples in Canada and Northern Europe demonstrated the reliability and convenience of these systems in terms of both energy and economic savings, but more demonstration sites are however necessary. The surrounding litho-, hydro- and bio-sphere are influenced by the plant's activity and a trustworthy supervision of the temperature field would bring advantages to both the environment and the system's efficiency. Usually numerical modeling is used to forecast the system behavior but results of simulations can be strongly dependent from assumed material characteristics and should be strictly calibrated on real data. To better understand thermal processes in the ground related to thermal injection and thermal storage, a field scale BTES living lab was build up nearby Torino (Northern Italy) within unsaturated alluvial deposits. Results show that approximately 9.1 GJ were transferred to the ground during the first year, raising the undisturbed temperature by 2 °C, and that a correct comparison of monitoring data and numerical simulations can be obtained following a specific site characterization.},

Hazard development in these areas is affected by process interactions and chain reactions, the ongoing shift of cryospheric hazard zones due to atmospheric warming, the large spatial scales involved and the remoteness of many permafrost-related threats. This paper reviews ground-based, airborne and spaceborne remote sensing methods suitable for permafrost hazard assessment and management. A wide range of image classification and change detection techniques support permafrost hazard studies. Digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from optical stereo, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) or laser scanning data are some of the most important data sets for investigating permafrost-related mass movements, thaw and heave processes, and hydrologcal hazards. Mulit-temporal optical or SAR data are used to derive surface displacements on creeping and unstable frozen slopes. Combining STMs with results from spectral image classification, and with multi-temporal data from change detection and displacement measurements significantly improves the detection of hazard potential.},

abstract = {This paper reports results of an experiment initiated in 1977 to determine the effects of climate on permafrost in Alaska. Permafrost observatories with boreholes were established along a north-south transect of Alaska in undisturbed permafrost terrain. The analysis and interpretation of annual temperature measurements in the boreholes and daily temperature measurements of the air, ground and permafrost surfaces made with automated temperature loggers are reported. Permafrost temperatures warmed along this transect coincident with a statewide warming of air temperatures that began in 1977. At two sites on the Arctic Coastal Plain, the warming was seasonal, greatest during "winter" months (October through May) and least during "summer" months (June through September). Permafrost temperatures peaked in the early 1980s and then decreased in response to slightly cooler air temperatures and thinner snow covers. Arctic sites began warming again typically about 1986 and Interior Alaska sites about 1988. Gulkana, the southernmost site, has been warming slowly since it was drilled in 1983. Air temperatures were relatively warm and snow covers were thicker-than-normal from the late 1980s into the late 1990s allowing permafrost temperatures to continue to warm. Temperatures at some sites leveled off or cooled slightly at the turn of the century. Two sites (Yukon River Bridge and Livengood) cooled during the period of observations. The magnitude of the total warming at the surface of the permafrost (through 2003) was 3 to 4??C for the Arctic Coastal Plain, 1 to 2??C for the Brooks Range including its northern and southern foothills, and 0.3 to 1??C south of the Yukon River. While the data are sparse, permafrost is warming throughout the region north of the Brooks Range, southward along the transect from the Brooks Range to the Chugach Mountains (except for Yukon River and Livengood), in Interior Alaska throughout the Tanana River region, and in the region south of the Alaska Range from Tok westward to Gulkana (in the Copper River Valley) and beyond to the Talkeetna Mountains. Thermal offset allows permafrost to survive in the presence of positive annual mean ground surface temperatures and was observed repeatedly since 1987 at two sites. The observed warming has not produced an increasing trend in maximum active layer thicknesses due to its seasonality. Near Healy, permafrost has been thawing at the top since the late 1980s at about 10 cm/yr. At Gulkana, permafrost was thawing from the bottom at a rate of 4 cm/yr that accelerated to 9 cm/yr after 2000. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A scaling analysis of the mass and momentum conservation equations shows that glacier volumes can be related by a power law to more easily observed glacier surface areas. The relationship requires four closure choices for the scaling behavior of glacier widths, slopes, side drag and mass balance. Reasonable closures predict a volume-area scaling exponent which is consistent with observations, giving a physical and practical basis for estimating ice volumes. Glacier volume is insensitive to perturbations in the mass balance scaling, but changes in average accumulation area ratios reflect significant changes in the scaling of both mass balance and ice volume.},

It is based on analytic minimization of the Gibbs energy function, which is possible in the case when neighborhood pixels of the velocity maps are considered independent. By joining scalar DInSAR data and vector GPS data, the technique allows us to achieve significant improvement in accuracy in the components of the velocity vector in comparison with the GPS data alone. In the accompanying example, the method is used for the investigation of the creep motion of the southern San Andreas fault around the Salton Sea region. The velocity maps are calculated for two time periods (1992-1998 and 1997-2001) and also for 3D and 2D cases. The preliminary analysis of the optimized data suggests that creep on the San Andreas fault in this region is time-dependent. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The COSI-Corr image correlation technique was evaluated to quantify and map terrain displacements. The magnitude and direction of the displacement vectors derived from correlating two hillshaded DEM layers corresponded to a visual interpretation of landslide change. Results show that the algorithm can accurately map displacements of the toes, chunks of soil, and vegetation patches on top of the landslide, but is not capable of mapping the retreat of the main scarp. The conclusion is that UAV-based imagery in combination with 3D scene reconstruction and image correlation algorithms provide flexible and effective tools to map and monitor landslide dynamics.},

In the days and weeks preceding the landslide, several smaller avalanches initiated from the same slope. The ice and rock debris traveled a maximum horizontal distance 5.76 km with a maximum vertical descent of 2,160 m, leaving a deposit 3.66 km 2 in area on Steele Glacier. The seismic magnitude estimated from long-period surface waves (M s) is 5.2. Modeling of the waveforms suggests an estimated duration of approximately 100 s and an average velocity of between 35 and 65 m/s. This landslide is one of 18 large rock avalanches known to have occurred since 1899 on slopes adjacent to glaciers in western Canada. We describe the setting, reconstruct the event chronology and present a preliminary characterization of the Mount Steele ice and rock avalanches based on field reconnaissance, analysis of seismic records and an airborne LiDAR survey.

abstract = {Permafrost underlies much of Earth's surface and interacts with climate, eco-systems and human systems. It is a complex phenomenon controlled by climate and (sub-) surface properties and reacts to change with variable delay. Heterogeneity and sparse data challenge the modeling of its spatial distribution. Currently, there is no data set to adequately inform global studies of permafrost. The available data set for the Northern Hemisphere is frequently used for model evaluation, but its quality and consistency are difficult to assess. Here, a global model of permafrost extent and dataset of permafrost zonation are presented and discussed, extending earlier studies by including the Southern Hemisphere, by consistent data and methods, by attention to uncertainty and scaling. Established relationships between air temperature and the occurrence of permafrost are re-formulated into a model that is parametrized using published estimates. It is run with a high-resolution ({\{}{\$}\backslash{\$}textless{\}}1 km) global elevation data and air temperatures based on the NCAR-NCEP reanalysis and CRU TS 2.0. The resulting data provide more spatial detail and a consistent extrapolation to remote regions, while aggregated values resemble previous studies. The estimated uncertainties affect regional patterns and aggregate number, and provide interesting insight. The permafrost area, i.e. the actual surface area underlain by permafrost, north of 60{\^{A}}° S is estimated to be 13{\^{a}}€“18 {\~{A}}— 106 km2 or 9{\^{a}}€“14 {\%} of the exposed land surface. The global permafrost area including Antarctic and sub-sea permafrost is estimated to be 16{\^{a}}€“21 {\~{A}}— 106 km2. The global permafrost region, i.e. the exposed land surface below which some permafrost can be expected, is estimated to be 22 {\^{A}}± 3 {\~{A}}— 106 km2. A large proportion of this exhibits considerable topography and spatially-discontinuous permafrost, underscoring the importance of attention to scaling issues and heterogeneity in large-area models.},

abstract = {An unstable rock slump, estimated at 5 to 10×106 m3, lies perched above the northern shore of Tidal Inlet in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. This landslide mass has the potential to rapidly move into Tidal Inlet and generate large, long-periodimpulse tsunami waves. Field and photographic examination revealed that the landslide moved between 1892 and 1919 after the retreat of the Little Ice Age glaciers from Tidal Inlet in 1890. Global positioning system measurements over a 2-year period show that the perched mass is presently moving at 3–4 cmannually indicating the landslide remains unstable. Numerical simulations of landslidegenerated waves suggest that in the western arm of Glacier Bay, wave amplitudes would be greatest near the mouth of Tidal Inlet and slightly decrease with water depth according to Green's law. As a function of time, wave amplitude would be greatest within approximately 40 min of the landslide entering water, with significant wave activity continuing for potentially several hours.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright}2015 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.Molards are conical-shaped, often symmetrical debris mounds with a distinctive radial grain size gradation, which were first named in the Alps over 100 years ago. Historically, these landforms did not receive much academic attention as they were rarely observed. Today, six different genetic hypotheses can be applied to molards, and the most recent has suggested a link to permafrost failure. The aim of this research was to test the hypothesis that molards result from the failure of permafrost-bearing ground and subsequent thawing of the frozen debris boulders. This hypothesis is tested by: (1) reviewing the known global distribution of molard-bearing mass movements with respect to permafrost distribution; (2) investigating a landslide in the Andes of Argentina that unequivocally relates to permafrost failure; (3) describing and interpreting the external and internal structure of molards, applying sedimentary transport concepts; and (4) reproducing molards by laboratory simulation. The results show that, with few exceptions, molards are produced by melt-out of ground ice in permafrost blocks. In particular, a permafrost source of the mass flow is more certain for landslide deposits that are densely populated by molards. This study serves to reappraise the presence of molards as they could be used to track ground ice loss and potential permafrost degradation in mountainous areas and hence climate change.

abstract = {We present a novel methodology for integration of multiple InSAR data sets for computation of two dimensional time series of ground deformation. The proposed approach allowscombination of SAR data acquired with different acquisition parameters, temporal and spatial sampling and resolution, wavelength and polarization. Produced time series have combined coverage, improved temporal resolution and lower noise level. We apply this methodology for mapping coal mining related ground subsidence and uplift in the Greater Region of Luxembourg along the French-German border. For this we processed 167 Synthetic Aperture Radar ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT images acquired between 1995 and 2009 from one ascending (track 29) and one descending (track 337) tracks and created over five hundred interferograms that were used for time series analysis. Derived vertical and east-west linear deformation rates show with remarkable precision a region of localized ground deformation located above and caused by mining and post-mining activities. Time series of ground deformation display temporal variability: reversal from subsidence to uplift and acceleration of subsidence in the vertical component, and horizontal motion toward the center of the subsidence on the east-west component. InSAR results are validated by leveling measurements collected by the French Geological Survey (BRGM) during 2006-2008. We determined that deformationrate changes are mainly caused by water level variations in the mines. Due to higher temporal and spatial resolution the proposed space-borne method detected a larger number of subsidence and uplift areas in comparison to leveling measurements restricted to annual monitoring of benchmark points along roads. We also identified one deformation region that is not precisely located above the mining sites. Comparison of InSAR measurements with the water levels measured in the mining pits suggest that part of the water that filled thegalleries after termination of the dewatering systems may come from this region. Providing that enough SAR data is available, this method opens new opportunities for detecting and locating man-made and natural ground deformation signals with high temporal resolution and precision. {\textcopyright}2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In September 2002, a catastrophic geomorphic event occurred in the Caucasus Mountains, southern Russia, in which almost the entire mass of Kolka Glacier detached from its bed, accelerated to a very high velocity (max. 65-80 m/s), and traveled a total distance of 19 km downstream as a glacier-debris flow. Based on the interpretation of satellite imagery obtained only 8.5 h before the event occurred, the analysis of seismograms from nearby seismic stations, and subsequent detailed field observations and measurements, we suggest that this remarkable event was not a response to impulse loading from a rock avalanche in the mountainside above the glacier, or to glacier surging, but due entirely to the static and delayed catastrophic response of the Kolka glacier to ice and debris loading over a period of months prior to the September 20 detachment. We reconstruct the glacier-debris flow using field observations in conjunction with the interpretation of seismographs from nearby seismic stations and successfully simulate the behaviour (runout, velocity, and deposition) of the post-detachment glacier-debris flow using a three-dimensional analytical model. Our demonstration of a standing-start hypothesis in the 2002 Kolka Glacier detachment has substantial implications for glacier hazard assessment and risk management strategies in valleys downstream from unstable debris-covered glaciers in the mountain regions of the world. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this study, we used an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to collect a time series of high-resolution images over four years at seven epochs to assess landslide dynamics. Structure from Motion (SfM) was applied to create Digital Surface Models (DSMs) of the landslide surface with an accuracy of 4–5 cm in the horizontal and 3–4 cm in the vertical direction. The accuracy of the co-registration of subsequent DSMs was checked and corrected based on comparing non-active areas of the landslide, which minimized alignment errors to a mean of 0.07 m. Variables such as landslide area and the leading edge slope were measured and temporal patterns were discovered. Volumetric changes of particular areas of the landslide were measured over the time series. Surface movement of the landslide was tracked and quantified with the COSI-Corr image correlation algorithm but without ground validation. Historical aerial photographs were used to create a baseline DSM, and the total displacement of the landslide was found to be approximately 6630 m3. This study has demonstrated a robust and repeatable algorithm that allows a landslide's dynamics to be mapped and monitored with a UAV over a relatively long time series.},

It started on the north-northeast wall of Dzhimarai-Khokh (4780 m a.s.l.) and seriously affected the valley of Genaldon/Karmadon. Immediate governmental actions, available scientific information, first reconstructions, hazard assessments and monitoring activities as well as initial expert judgments/recommendations are documented in order to enable more detailed analyses and modelling of the event by the wider scientific community. Among the most remarkable aspects related to this event are (1) the relation between the recent event and somewhat smaller but quite similar events that occurred earlier in historical times (1835, 1902), (2) the interactions between unstable local geological structures and complex geothermal and hydraulic conditions in the starting zone with permafrost, cold to polythermal hanging glaciers and volcanic effects (hot springs) in close contact with each other, (3) the erosion and incorporation of a debris-covered valley glacier largely enhancing the sliding volume of rocks, ice, firn, snow, water and probably air to a total of about 100 {\~{A}}— 106 m3, and (4) the astonishingly high flow velocities (up to 300 km h{\^{a}}ˆ'1) and enormous length of travel path (18 km plus 15 km of debris/mud-flow).

abstract = {Geophysical applications of radar interferometry to measure changes in the Earth's surface have exploded in the early 1990s. This new geodetic technique calculates the interference pattern caused by the difference in phase between two images acquired by a spaceborne synthetic aperture radar at two distinct times. The resulting interferogram is a contour map of the change in distance between the ground and the radar instrument. These maps provide an unsurpassed spatial sampling density ( 100 pixels km 2), a competitive precision ( 1 cm), and a useful observation cadence (1 pass month 1). They record movements in the crust, perturbations in the atmosphere, dielectric modifications in the soil, and relief in the topography. They are also sensitive to technical effects, such as relative variations in the radar's trajectory or variations in its frequency standard. We describe how all these phenomena contribute to an interferogram. Then a practical summary explains the techniques for calculating and manipulating interferograms from various radar instruments, including the four satellites currently in orbit: ERS-1, ERS-2, JERS-1, and RADARSAT. The next chapter suggests some guidelines for interpreting an interferogram as a geophysical measurement: respecting the limits of the technique, assessing its uncertainty, recognizing artifacts, and discriminating different types of signal. We then review the geophysical applications published to date, most of which study deformation related to earthquakes, volcanoes, and glaciers using ERS-1 data. We also show examples of monitoring natural hazards and environmental alterations related to landslides, subsidence, and agriculture. In addition, we consider subtler geophysical signals such as postseismic relaxation, tidal loading of coastal areas, and interseismic strain accumulation. We conclude with our perspectives on the future of radar interferometry. The objective of the review is for the reader to develop the physical understanding necessary to calculate an interferogram and the geophysical intuition necessary to interpret it.},

abstract = {The number of large slope failures in some high-mountain regions such as the European Alps has increased during the past two to three decades. There is concern that recent climate change is driving this increase in slope failures, thus possibly further exacerbating the hazard in the future. Although the effects of a gradual temperature rise on glaciers and permafrost have been extensively studied, the impacts of short-term, unusually warm temperature increases on slope stability in high mountains remain largely unexplored. We describe several large slope failures in rock and ice in recent years in Alaska, New Zealand and the European Alps, and analyse weather patterns in the days and weeks before the failures. Although we did not find one general temperature pattern, all the failures were preceded by unusually warm periods; some happened immediately after temperatures suddenly dropped to freezing. We assessed the frequency of warm extremes in the future by analysing eight regional climate models from the recently completed European Union programme ENSEMBLES for the central Swiss Alps. The models show an increase in the higher frequency of high-temperature events for the period 2001-2050 compared with a 1951-2000 reference period. Warm events lasting 5, 10 and 30 days are projected to increase by about 1.5-4 times by 2050 and in some models by up to 10 times. Warm extremes can trigger large landslides in temperature-sensitive high mountains by enhancing the production of water by melt of snow and ice, and by rapid thaw. Although these processes reduce slope strength, they must be considered within the local geological, glaciological and topographic context of a slope.},

abstract = {Debris flows are fast mass movements formed by a mix of water and solid materials, which occur in steep torrents, and are a source of high risks for human settlements. Geophones are widely used to detect the ground vibration induced by passing debris flows. However, the recording of geophone signals usually requires storing a huge amount of data, which leads to problems in storage capacity and power consumption. This paper presents a method to transform and simplify the signals measured by geophones. The key input parameter is the ground velocity threshold, which removes the seismic noise that is not related to debris flows. A signal conditioner was developed to implement the transformation and the ground velocity threshold was set by electrical resistors. The signal conditioner was installed at various European monitoring sites to test the method. Results show that data amount and power consumption can be greatly reduced without losing much information on the main features of the debris flows. However, the outcome stresses the importance of choosing a ground vibration threshold, which must be accurately calibrated. The transformation is also suitable to detect other rapid mass movements and to distinguish among different processes, which points to a possible implementation in alarm systems.},

abstract = {Temperature profiles measured in permafrost in northernmost Alaska usually have anomalous curvature in the upper 100 meters or so. When analyzed by heat-conduction theory, the profiles indicate a variable but widespread secular warming of the permafrost surface, generally in the range of 2 to 4 Celsius degrees during the last few decades to a century. Although details of the climatic change cannot be resolved with existing data, there is little doubt of its general magnitude and timing; alternative explanations are limited by the fact that heat transfer in cold permafrost is exclusively by conduction. Since models of greenhouse warming predict climatic change will be greatest in the Arctic and might already be in progress, it is prudent to attempt to understand the rapidly changing thermal regime in this region.},

Their unpredictability and frequent location in remote areas have made observations of their dynamics rare. Through real-time detection and inverse modeling of teleseismic data, we show that landslide dynamics are primarily determined by the length scale of the source mass. When combined with geometric constraints from satellite imagery, the seismically determined landslide force histories yield estimates of landslide duration, momenta, potential energy loss, mass, and runout trajectory. Measurements of these dynamical properties for 29 teleseismogenic landslides are consistent with a simple acceleration model in which height drop and rupture depth scale with the length of the failing slope.},

abstract = {High spatial resolution measurements of interseismic deformation along major faults are critical for understanding the earthquake cycle and for assessing earthquake hazard. We propose a new remove/filter/restore technique to optimally combine GPS and InSAR data to measure interseismic crustal deformation, considering the spacing of GPS stations in California and the characteristics of interseismic signal and noise using InSAR. To constrain the longer wavelengths ({\textgreater}40 km) we use GPS measurements, combined with a dislocation model, and for the shorter wavelength information we rely on InSAR measurements. Expanding the standard techniques, which use a planar ramp to remove long wavelength error, we use a Gaussian filter technique. Our method has the advantage of increasing the signal-to-noise ratio, controlling the variance of atmosphere error, and being isotropic. Our theoretical analysis indicates this technique can improve the signal-to-noise ratio by up to 20{\%}. We test this method along three segments of the San Andreas Fault (Southern section near Salton Sea, Creeping section near Parkfield and Mojave/Big Bend section near Los Angeles), and find improvements of 26{\%}, 11{\%} and 8{\%} in these areas, respectively. Our data shows a zone of uplift to the west of the Creeping section of the San Andreas Fault and an area of subsidence near the city of Lancaster. This work suggests that after only 5 years of data collection, ALOS interferograms will provide a major improvement in measuring details of interseismic deformation. {\textcopyright}2010 COSPAR.

abstract = {This study is presented within the context that climate warming and sea-ice decline has been occurring throughout much of the Arctic over the past several decades, and that terrestrial ecosystems at high latitudes are sensitive to the resultant alterations in surface temperatures. Results are from analyzing interannual satellite records of vegetation greenness across a bioclimate gradient of the Canadian Arctic over the period of 1982-2006. Here, we combine multi-scale sub-pixel analysis and remote sensing time-series analysis to investigate recent decadal changes in vegetation greenness along spatial gradients of summer temperature and vegetation. Linear autoregression temporal analysis of vegetation greenness was performed with relatively "pure" vegetation pixels of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, spanning Low Arctic, High Arctic and polar desert ecosystems. Vegetation greenness generally increased over tundra ecosystems in the past two decades. Peak annual greenness increased 0.49-0.79{\%}/yr over the High Arctic where prostrate dwarf shrubs, forbs, mosses and lichens dominate and 0.46-0.67{\%}/yr over the Low Arctic where erect dwarf shrubs and graminoids dominate. However, magnitudes of vegetation greenness differ with length of time series and periods considered, indicating a nonlinear response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. The decadal increases of greenness reflect increasing vegetation production during the peak of the growing season, and were likely driven by the recent warming.},

abstract = {Temperature index or degree-day models rest upon a claimed relationship between snow or ice melt and air temperature usually expressed in the form of positive temperatures. Since air temperature generally is the most readily available data, such models have been the most widely used method of ice and snow melt computations for many purposes, such as hydrological modelling, ice dynamic modelling or climate sensitivity studies. Despite their simplicity, temperature-index models have proven to be powerful tools for melt modelling, often on a catchment scale outperforming energy balance models. However, two shortcomings are evident: (1) although working well over long time periods their accuracy decreases with increasing temporal resolution; (2) spatial variability cannot be modelled accurately as melt rates may vary substantially due to topographic effects such as shading, slope and aspect angles. These effects are particularly crucial in mountain areas. This paper provides an overview of temperature-index methods, including glacier environments, and discusses recent advances on distributed approaches attempting to account for topographic effects in complex terrain, while retaining scarcity of data input. In the light of an increasing demand for melt estimates with high spatial and temporal resolution, such approaches need further refinement and development. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B. V.

abstract = {Climate change, manifested by an increase in mean, minimum, and maximum temperatures and by more intense rainstorms, is becoming more evident in many regions. An important consequence of these changes may be an increase in landslides in high mountains. More research, however, is necessary to detect changes in landslide magnitude and frequency related to contemporary climate, particularly in alpine regions hosting glaciers, permafrost, and snow. These regions not only are sensitive to changes in both temperature and precipitation, but are also areas in which landslides are ubiquitous even under a stable climate. We analyze a series of catastrophic slope failures that occurred in the mountains of Europe, the Americas, and the Caucasus since the end of the 1990s. We distinguish between rock and ice avalanches, debris flows from de-glaciated areas, and landslides that involve dynamic interactions with glacial and river processes. Analysis of these events indicates several important controls on slope stability in high mountains, including: the non-linear response of firn and ice to warming; three-dimensional warming of subsurface bedrock and its relation to site geology; de-glaciation accompanied by exposure of new sediment; and combined short-term effects of precipitation and temperature. Based on several case studies, we propose that the following mechanisms can significantly alter landslide magnitude and frequency, and thus hazard, under warming conditions: (1) positive feedbacks acting on mass movement processes that after an initial climatic stimulus may evolve independently of climate change; (2) threshold behavior and tipping points in geomorphic systems; (3) storage of sediment and ice involving important lag-time effects.

abstract = {Surges and glacier avalanches are expressions of glacier instability, and among the most dramatic phenomena in the mountain cryosphere. Until now, the catastrophic collapse of a glacier, combining the large volume of surges and mobility of ice avalanches, has been reported only for the 2002 130 × 106 m3 detachment of Kolka Glacier (Caucasus Mountains), which has been considered a globally singular event. Here, we report on the similar detachment of the entire lower parts of two adjacent glaciers in western Tibet in July and September 2016, leading to an unprecedented pair of giant low-angle ice avalanches with volumes of 68 ± 2 × 106 m3 and 83 ± 2 × 106 m3. On the basis of satellite remote sensing, numerical modelling and field investigations, we find that the twin collapses were caused by climate- and weather-driven external forcing, acting on specific polythermal and soft-bed glacier properties. These factors converged to produce surge-like enhancement of driving stresses and massively reduced basal friction connected to subglacial water and fine-grained bed lithology, to eventually exceed collapse thresholds in resisting forces of the tongues frozen to their bed. Our findings show that large catastrophic instabilities of low-angle glaciers can happen under rare circumstances without historical precedent.},

abstract = {On 17 October 2015, a landslide of roughly 60×106m3occurred at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier in Taan Fiord, southeastern Alaska. It caused a tsunami that inundated an area over 20km2, whereas the landslide debris itself deposited within a much smaller area of approximately 2km2. It is a unique event in that the landslide debris was deposited into three very different environments: on the glacier surface, on land, and in the marine waters of the fjord. Part of the debris traversed the width of the fjord and re-emerged onto land, depositing coherent hummocks with preserved source stratigraphy on an alluvial fan and adjacent moraines on the far side of the fjord. Imagery from before the landslide shows that the catastrophic slope failure was preceded by deformation and sliding for at least the two decades since the glacier retreated to its current terminus location, exposing steep and extensively faulted slopes. A small volume of the total slide mass remains within the source area and is topped by striated blocks ({\textgreater}10m across) and standing trees that were transported down the slope in intact positions during the landslide. Field work was carried out in the summer of 2016, and by the time this paper was written, almost all of the supraglacial debris was advected into the fjord and half the subaerial hummocks were buried by glacial advance; this rapid change illustrates how highly active sedimentary processes in high-altitude glacial settings can skew any landslide-frequency analyses, and emphasizes the need for timely field investigations of these natural hazards.},

@article{Sauber2004,
abstract = {Across the plate boundary zone in south central Alaska, tectonic strain rates are high in a region that includes large glaciers undergoing wastage (glacier retreat and thinning) and surges. For the coastal region between the Bering and Malaspina Glaciers, the average ice mass thickness changes between 1995 and 2000 range from 1 to 5 m/year. These ice changes caused solid Earth displacements in our study region with predicted values of -10 to 50 mm in the vertical and predicted horizontal displacements of 0-10 mm at variable orientations. Relative to stable North America, observed horizontal rates of tectonic deformation range from 10 to 40 mm/year to the north-northwest and the predicted tectonic uplift rates range from approximately 0 mm/year near the Gulf of Alaska coast to 12 mm/year further inland. The ice mass changes between 1995 and 2000 resulted in discernible changes in the Global Positioning System (GPS) measured station positions of one site (ISLE) located adjacent to the Bagley Ice Valley and at one site, DON, located south of the Bering Glacier terminus. In addition to modifying the surface displacements rates, we evaluated the influence ice changes during the Bering glacier surge cycle had on the background seismic rate. We found an increase in the number of earthquakes (ML≥2.5) and seismic rate associated with ice thinning and a decrease in the number of earthquakes and seismic rate associated with ice thickening. These results support the hypothesis that ice mass changes can modulate the background seismic rate. During the last century, wastage of the coastal glaciers in the Icy Bay and Malaspina region indicates thinning of hundreds of meters and in areas of major retreat, maximum losses of ice thickness approaching 1 km. Between the 1899 Yakataga and Yakutat earthquakes (Mw=8.1, 8.1) and prior to the 1979 St. Elias earthquake (M s=7.2), the plate interface below Icy Bay was locked and tectonic strain accumulated. We used estimated ice mass change during the 1899-1979 time period to calculate the change in the fault stability margin (FSM) prior to the 1979 St. Elias earthquake. Our results suggest that a cumulative decrease in the fault stability margin at seismogenic depths, due to ice wastage over 80 years, was large, up to ∼2 MPa. Ice wastage would promote thrust faulting in events such as the 1979 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks.},

abstract = {A novel, multidimensional small baseline subset (MSBAS) methodology is presented for integration of multiple interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data sets for computation of 2- or 3-D time-series of deformation. The proposed approach allows the combination of all possible air-borne and space-borne SAR data acquired with different acquisition parameters, temporal and spatial sampling and resolution, wave-band and polarization. The produced time-series have improved temporal resolution and can be enhanced by applying either regularization or temporal filtering to remove high-frequency noise. We apply this methodology to map 2003–2010 ground deformation of the Virunga Volcanic Province (VVP), North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo. The horizontal and vertical time-series of ground displacement clearly identify lava compaction areas, long-term deformation of Mt Nyamuragira and 2004, 2006 and 2010 pre- and coeruptive deformation. Providing that enough SAR data is available, the method opens new opportunities for detecting ground motion in the VVP and elsewhere.},

abstract = {Accurate inversion of land surface geo/biophysical variables from remote sensing data for earth observation applications is an essential and challenging topic for the global change research. Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from the space. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion. In this paper, we compared three different approaches for LST inversion from TIRS, including the radiative transfer equation-based method, the split-window algorithm and the single channel method. Four selected energy balance monitoring sites from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) were used for validation, combining with the MODIS 8 day emissivity product. For the investigated sites and scenes, results show that the LST inverted from the radiative transfer equation-based method using band 10 has the highest accuracy with RMSE lower than 1 K, while the SW algorithm has moderate accuracy and the SC method has the lowest accuracy.},

abstract = {We carry out a broad-band analysis of the seismic signals generated by a massive landslide that occurred near Icy Bay (Alaska) on 2015 October 17. The event generated seismic signals recorded globally. Using Instaseis, a recently developed tool for rapid computation of complete broad-band synthetic seismograms, we simulate the seismic wave propagation between the event and five seismic stations located around the landslide. By modeling the broad-band seismograms in the period band 5–200 s, we reconstruct by inversion a time-varying point force to characterize the landslide time history. We compute the broad-band spectrum of the landslide force history and find that it has a corner period of about 100 s, corresponding to the duration of sliding. In contrast with standard earthquakes, the landslide force spectrum below the corner frequency decays as $\omega$, while the spectral amplitudes at higher frequencies is proportional to $\omega$−2, similar to the rate of spectral decay seen in earthquakes. From the inverted force history and an estimate of the final run-out distance, we deduce the mass, the trajectory and characteristics of the landslide dynamics associated with the centre of mass, such as acceleration, velocity, displacement and friction. Inferring an effective run-out distance of ∼900 m from a satellite image, we estimate a landslide mass of ∼150 million metric tons.},

abstract = {In September 1996, 210,000 m3 of glacier ice broke off from the Gutzgletscher which is situated in the north-west face of the Wetterhorn above Grindelwald (Bernese Alps, Switzerland). The ice masse dropped down the 1000-m high rock face and formed two huge powder avalanches. The avalanche debris blocked a road and the air pressure injured three people. The avalanche history of the Gutzgletscher is well-documented. The second case study we describe is situated below the top of the Grandes Jorasses in the Italian part of the Mont Blanc Massif. In January 1997, a part of the hanging glacier broke off. The time of the event was predicted by displacement measurements at the front of the hanging glacier. Below the hanging glacier, there are huge starting zones for snow avalanches. Because the break-off was expected during a period with considerable avalanche hazard, it was assumed that the ice masses could release big snow avalanches. For that reason, we proposed to evacuate the valley below the hanging glacier. The breaking off occurred a few days after the important snowfall, so that the snowpack had stabilized and no snow avalanches were observed. There were no damages. For both cases, the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research (SLF) prepared hazard maps and worked out corresponding safety plans in collaboration with the Laboratory for Hydraulics, Hydrology and Glaciology (VAW). The main principles and difficulties of hazard assessment for ice avalanches are described based on the two case studies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, The Author(s). Glacial retreat in recent decades has exposed unstable slopes and allowed deep water to extend beneath some of those slopes. Slope failure at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier on 17 October 2015 sent 180 million tons of rock into Taan Fiord, Alaska. The resulting tsunami reached elevations as high as 193 m, one of the highest tsunami runups ever documented worldwide. Precursory deformation began decades before failure, and the event left a distinct sedimentary record, showing that geologic evidence can help understand past occurrences of similar events, and might provide forewarning. The event was detected within hours through automated seismological techniques, which also estimated the mass and direction of the slide - all of which were later confirmed by remote sensing. Our field observations provide a benchmark for modeling landslide and tsunami hazards. Inverse and forward modeling can provide the framework of a detailed understanding of the geologic and hazards implications of similar events. Our results call attention to an indirect effect of climate change that is increasing the frequency and magnitude of natural hazards near glaciated mountains.},

abstract = {The propagation of the rupture of the Mw 7.9 Denali fault earthquake from the central Denali fault onto the Totschunda fault has provided a basis for dynamic models of fault branching in which the angle of the regional or local prestress relative to the orientation of the main fault and branch plays a principal role in determining which fault branch is taken. GeoEarthScope LiDAR and paleoseismic data allow us to map the structure of the Denali-Totschunda fault intersection and evaluate controls of fault branching from a geological perspective. LiDAR data reveal the Denali-Totschunda fault intersection is structurally simple with the two faults directly connected. At the branch point, 227.2†km east of the 2002 epicenter, the 2002 rupture diverges southeast to become the Totschunda fault. We use paleoseismic data to propose that differences in the accumulated strain on each fault segment, which express differences in the elapsed time since the most recent event, was one important control of the branching direction. We suggest that data on event history, slip rate, paleo offsets, fault geometry and structure, and connectivity, especially on high slip rate-short recurrence interval faults, can be used to assess the likelihood of branching and its direction. Analysis of the Denali-Totschunda fault intersection has implications for evaluating the potential for a rupture to propagate across other types of fault intersections and for characterizing sources of future large earthquakes.},

A set of supraglacial ponds rapidly filled between April and July 2017 on Changri Shar Glacier in the Everest region of Nepal, coalescing into a {\~{}}180,000m2 lake before sudden and complete drainage through Changri Shar and Khumbu Glaciers 15{\&}ndash;17 July. We use a suite of PlanetScope and Pl{\'{e}}iades satellite orthoimagery to document the system's evolution over its very short filling period and to assess the glacial and proglacial effects of the outburst flood. We additionally use high resolution stereo digital elevation models (DEMs) to complete a detailed analysis of the event's ablative and geomorphic effects. Finally, measurement of the flood's passage at a stream gauge 4km downstream enables a refined interpretation of the chronology and overall magnitude of the outburst. We infer largely subsurface drainage through both glaciers located on its flowpath, and efficent drainage through Khumbu Glacier. The drainage and subsequent outburst of 1.36{\&}pm;0.19x106m3 impounded water had a clear geomorphic impact on glacial and proglacial topography at least as far as 11km downstream, including deep incision and landsliding along the Changri Nup proglacial stream, the collapse of shallow englacial conduits near the Khumbu terminus and extensive, enhanced bank erosion below Khumbu Glacier. These sudden changes led to the rerouting of major trails in three locations, demonstrating the potential hazard that short-lived, relatively small glacial lakes pose.},

Combining glacier outlines of the globally complete Randolph Glacier Inventory with terrain elevation models (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission/Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer), we use a simple dynamic model to obtain spatially distributed thickness of individual glaciers by inverting their surface topography. Results are validated against a comprehensive set of thickness observations for 300 glaciers from most glacierized regions of the world. For all mountain glaciers and ice caps outside of the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets we find a total ice volume of 170 × 103 ± 21 × 103 km3, or 0.43 ± 0.06 m of potential sea level rise.},

abstract = {The role of post-Little Ice Age (LIA) Neoglacial retreat on landslide activity is investigated in 19 alpine basins along the upper Lillooet River Valley, British Columbia. We examine how Neoglacial scouring and glacial recession have modified hillslope form and slope stability, and construct a decision-making flowchart to identify landslide hazards associated with glacial retreat. This work is based on field mapping, GIS analysis, statistical associations between landslides and terrain attributes, and a comparison between Neoglaciated and non-Neoglaciated terrain within each basin. The bedrock landslide response to glacial retreat varies appreciably according to lithology and the extent of glacial scour below the LIA trimline. Valleys carved in weak Quaternary volcanics show significant erosional oversteepening and contain deep-seated slope movement features, active rock fall, rock slides, and rock avalanches near glacial trimlines. Basins in stronger granitic rock rarely show increased bedrock instability resulting from post-LIA retreat, except for shallow-seated rock slides along some trimlines and failures on previously unstable slopes. In surficial materials, landslides associated with post-LIA retreat originate in till or colluvium, as debris slides or debris avalanches, and are concentrated along lateral moraines or glacial trimlines. Significant spatial association was also observed between recent catastrophic failures, gravitational slope deformation, and slopes that were oversteepened then debuttressed by glacial erosion. Eight out of nine catastrophic rock slope failures occurred just above glacial trimlines and all occurred in areas with a previous history of deep-seated gravitational slope movement, implying that this type of deformation is a precursor to catastrophic detachment. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The concept of the suction stress characteristic curve ?SSCC? for unsaturated soil is presented. Particle-scale equilibrium analyses are employed to distinguish three types of interparticle forces: ?1? active forces transmitted through the soil grains; ?2? active forces at or near interparticle contacts; and ?3? passive, or counterbalancing, forces at or near interparticle contacts. It is proposed that the second type of force, which includes physicochemical forces, cementation forces, surface tension forces, and the force arising from negative pore-water pressure, may be conceptually combined into a macroscopic stress called suction stress. Suction stress characteris- tically depends on degree of saturation, water content, or matric suction through the SSCC, thus paralleling well-established concepts of the soil–water characteristic curve and hydraulic conductivity function for unsaturated soils. The existence and behavior of the SSCC are experimentally validated by considering unsaturated shear strength data for a variety of soil types in the literature. Its characteristic nature and a methodology for its determination are demonstrated. The experimental evidence shows that both Mohr–Coulomb failure and critical state failure can be well represented by the SSCC concept. The SSCC provides a potentially simple and practical way to describe the state of stress in unsaturated soil. DOI:},

@article{Haeussler2018,
abstract = {A large subaerial landslide entered Taan Fiord, Alaska, on 17 October 2015 producing a tsunami with runup to 193 m. We use LiDAR data to show the slide volume to be 76 + 3/{\`{A}}4 million cubic meters and that 51,000,000 m 3 entered Taan Fiord. In 2016, we mapped the fjord with multibeam bathymetry and high-resolution seismic data. Landslide and postlandslide deposits extend 6 km downfjord, are up to 70 ± 11 m thick, and have a total volume of {\~{}}147,000,000 m 3. Seismic data image a blocky landslide unit and two units deposited immediately after the landslide. The blocky landslide unit is {\~{}}65,000,000 m 3. We infer it consists dominantly of subaerially derived material and secondarily of fjord floor sediment. The overlying units are likely megaturbidites presumably deposited within minutes to days after the landslide. We infer that these deposits dominantly consist of fjord floor material mobilized and suspended as the slide entered and traveled downfjord. The lower postlandslide unit is up to 35 ± 6 m thick, and the upper unit is up to 12 ± 3 m thick. These deposits are distinctive and will leave a lasting record of the event. This subaerial-to-submarine landslide deposit is distinct from other submarine landslide deposits studied in Alaskan fjords because it has a much greater thickness, larger and more angular blocks, distinctive postlandslide megaturbidites, and a higher-amplitude acoustic signature of the blocky deposit. The tight constraints on the landslide source and deposit volumes, topography, bathymetry, and tsunami runup heights and flow directions should make this a benchmark site for landslide-tsunami models. Plain Language Summary A giant landslide fell into Taan Fiord, Alaska, on 17 October 2015 and caused a tsunami that ran up 193 m-the fourth highest ever recorded. All 10 of the highest tsunami runups ever recorded were caused by this mechanism of a landslide entering a water body. These events are rare; most occurred more than 60 years ago, and the physical environment before and after the landslide are generally not well documented. In Taan Fiord, Alaska, we collected excellent postlandslide data of the Earth's surface, both above and below sea level. We are able to calculate the volume of the landslide and the volume that entered the fjord. We are able to image the landslide and postlandslide deposits, on and beneath the fjord bottom, up to 6 km away from where it entered the water. These deposits are distinctive in their character, up to 70 m thick, and we anticipate that other such deposits should be recognizable in other fjords. The careful documentation of the physical environment of the fjord before and after the landslide, combined with tsunami runup and flow directions, should make this a place where tsunami modelers can test their models to see if they work correctly.},

abstract = {Reliable multi-temporal landslide detection over longer periods of time requires multi-sensor time series data characterized by high internal geometric stability, as well as high relative and absolute accuracy. For this purpose, a new methodology for fully automated co-registration has been developed allowing efficient and robust spatial alignment of standard orthorectified data products originating from a multitude of optical satellite remote sensing data of varying spatial resolution. Correlation-based co-registration uses world-wide available terrain corrected Landsat Level 1T time series data as the spatial reference, ensuring global applicability. The developed approach has been applied to a multi-sensor time series of 592 remote sensing datasets covering an approximately 12,000 km2 area in Southern Kyrgyzstan (Central Asia) strongly affected by landslides. The database contains images acquired during the last 26 years by Landsat (E)TM, ASTER, SPOT and RapidEye sensors. Analysis of the spatial shifts obtained from co-registration has revealed sensor-specific alignments ranging between 5 m and more than 400 m. Overall accuracy assessment of these alignments has resulted in a high relative image-to-image accuracy of 17 m (RMSE) and a high absolute accuracy of 23 m (RMSE) for the whole co-registered database, making it suitable for multi-temporal landslide detection at a regional scale in Southern Kyrgyzstan.},

abstract = {Glaciers outside of the ice sheets are known to be important contributors to sea level rise. In this work, we provide an overview of changes in the mass of the world's glaciers, excluding those in Greenland and Antarctica, between 2002 and 2016, based on satellite gravimetry observations of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE). We find that over this 14-yr period, glaciers lost about 3000 Gigatonnes of mass, equivalent a sea level contribution of 8 mm. We present annual mass balances for 17 individual glaciers regions, that show a qualitatively good agreement with published estimates from in situ observations. We find that annual mass balance varies considerably from year to year, which can in part be attributed to changes in the large-scale circulation of the atmosphere. These variations, combined with the relatively short observational record, hamper the detection of acceleration of glacier mass loss. Our study highlights the need for continued observations of the Earth's glacierized regions.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Geospatial co-registration is a mandatory prerequisite when dealing with remote sensing data. Inter-or intra-sensoral misregistration will negatively affect any subsequent image analysis, specifically when processing multi-sensoral or multi-temporal data. In recent decades, many algorithms have been developed to enable manual, semi- or fully automatic displacement correction. Especially in the context of big data processing and the development of automated processing chains that aim to be applicable to different remote sensing systems, there is a strong need for efficient, accurate and generally usable co-registration. Here, we present AROSICS (Automated and Robust Open-Source Image Co-Registration Software), a Python-based open-source software including an easy-to-use user interface for automatic detection and correction of sub-pixel misalignments between various remote sensing datasets. It is independent of spatial or spectral characteristics and robust against high degrees of cloud coverage and spectral and temporal land cover dynamics. The co-registration is based on phase correlation for sub-pixel shift estimation in the frequency domain utilizing the Fourier shift th eorem in a moving-window manner. A dense grid of spatial shift vectors can be created and automatically filtered by combining various validation and quality estimation metrics. Additionally, the software supports the masking of, e.g., clouds and cloud shadows to exclude such areas from spatial shift detection. The software has been tested on more than 9000 satellite images acquired by different sensors. The results are evaluated exemplarily for two inter-sensoral and two intra-sensoral use cases and show registration results in the sub-pixel range with root mean square error fits around 0.3 pixels and better.},

From airborne radar surveys, we identify a 31-kilometer-wide, circular bedrock depression beneath up to a kilometer of ice. This depression has an elevated rim that cross-cuts tributary subglacial channels and a subdued central uplift that appears to be actively eroding. From ground investigations of the deglaciated foreland, we identify overprinted structures within Precambrian bedrock along the ice margin that strike tangent to the subglacial rim. Glaciofluvial sediment from the largest river draining the crater contains shocked quartz and other impact-related grains. Geochemical analysis of this sediment indicates that the impactor was a fractionated iron asteroid, which must have been more than a kilometer wide to produce the identified crater. Radiostratigraphy of the ice in the crater shows that the Holocene ice is continuous and conformable, but all deeper and older ice appears to be debris rich or heavily disturbed. The age of this impact crater is presently unknown, but from our geological and geophysical evidence, we conclude that it is unlikely to predate the Pleistocene inception of the Greenland Ice Sheet.},

abstract = {The manner by which meltwater drains through a glacier is critical to ice dynamics, runoff characteristics, and water quality. However, much of the contemporary knowledge relating to glacier hydrology has been based upon, and conditioned by, understanding gleaned from temperate valley glaciers. Globally, a significant proportion of glaciers and ice sheets exhibit nontemperate thermal regimes. The recent, growing concern over the future response of polar glaciers and ice sheets to forecasts of a warming climate and lengthening summer melt season necessitates recognition of the hydrological processes in these nontemperate ice masses. It is therefore timely to present an accessible review of the scientific progress in glacial hydrology where nontemperate conditions are dominant. This review provides an appraisal of the glaciological literature from nontemperate glaciers, examining supraglacial, englacial, and subglacial environments in sequence and their role in hydrological processes within glacierized catchments. In particular, the variability and complexity in glacier thermal regimes are discussed, illustrating how a unified model of drainage architecture is likely to remain elusive due to structural controls on the presence of water. Cold ice near glacier surfaces may reduce meltwater flux into the glacier interior, but observations suggest that the transient thermal layer of near surface ice holds a hydrological role as a depth-limited aquifer. Englacial flowpaths may arise from the deep incision of supraglacial streams or the propagation of hydrofractures, forms which are readily able to handle varied meltwater discharge or act as locations for water storage, and result in spatially discrete delivery of water to the subglacial environment. The influence of such drainage routes on seasonal meltwater release is explored, with reference to summer season upwellings and winter icing formation. Moreover, clear analogies emerge between nontemperate valley glacier and ice sheet hydrology, the discussion of which indicates how persistent reassessment of our conceptualization of glacier drainage systems is required. There is a clear emphasis that continued, integrated endeavors focused on process glaciology at nontemperate glaciers are a scientific imperative to augmenting the existing body of research centered on ice mass hydrology.},

abstract = {Measurements made at John Evans Glacier, eastern Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, Canada in 1994 and 1996 provide new insight into the internal hydrology of polythermal glaciers. During the early part of each melt season, supraglacial waters enter the glacier via a crevasse field about 4 km from the terminus and are stored in a subglacial reservoir. Release of the water from the reservoir occurs initially via an artesian fountain on the glacier surface and by upwelling of waters through subglacial sediments at the terminus (event1). Channelization of the subglacial waters then occurs and water is discharged as an outburst flood (event 2), which releases a considerably larger volume of water than event 1. Thus, drainage of the subglacial reservoir follows a cyclical pattern in which discharge oscillations increase in amplitude over time. The cycle may end with complete reservoir drainage. The total volume of water released was much greater in 1994 than in 1996, primarily because the 1994 melt season was longer and warmer than the 1996 season. Interannual differences in the form of the outflow hydrographs, and in the extent and timing of connections between the subglacial reservoir and marginal melt streams, are linked to variations in the size and rate of growth of the subglacial reservoir. This hydrological behaviour may have important implications for the dynamics of polythermal glaciers.},

abstract = {The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and their implications to climate change have sparked global interest in understanding the relative contribution of the electrical generation industry. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world emits approximately 27 gigatonnes of CO2e from multiple sources, with electrical production emitting 10 gigatonnes, or approximately 37{\%} of global emissions. In addition, electricity demand is expected to increase by 43{\%} over the next 20 years. This substantial increase will require the construction of many new power generating facilities and offers the opportunity to construct these new facilities in a way to limit GHG emissions. There are many different electrical generation methods, each having advantages and disadvantages with respect to operational cost, environmental impact, and other factors. In relation to GHG emissions, each generation method produces GHGs in varying quantities through construction, operation (including fuel supply activities), and decommissioning. Some generation methods such as coal fired power plants release the majority of GHGs during operation. Others, such as wind power and nuclear power, release the majority of emissions during construction and decommissioning. Accounting for emissions from all phases of the project (construction, operation, and decommissioning) is called a lifecycle approach. Normalizing the lifecycle emissions with electrical generation allows for a fair comparison of the different generation methods on a per gigawatt-hour basis. The lower the value, the less GHG emissions are emitted. The objective of this report is to provide a comparison of the lifecycle GHG emissions of different electricity generation facilities.},

abstract = {The field observations of G.S. Boulton stimulated widespread interest in deformable beds. Shear resistance of till in its critical state is insensitive to strain rate and increases linearly with effective pressure. During unsteady deformation, pseudo-viscous shear resistance can be caused by dilation of consolidated tills and resultant pore-pressure decline. This effect is probably uncommon, however, because susceptible tills of low hydraulic diffusivity are also those least likely to consolidate significantly during effective-pressure transients. Stick-slip motion at Whillans Ice Stream, Antarctica, indicates that its basal till must weaken during rapid slip and strengthen during longer periods of slower slip. Recurrence intervals for rapid-slip episodes there (6-18hours) indicate that till-strength variations, if driven by changes in pore pressure either related or unrelated to basal freezing, are focused in the uppermost several centimeters of the bed. Ploughing of grains at the bed surface and associated excess pore pressures in adjacent till can account for rate-weakening during rapid slip, with pore-pressure decay causing strengthening between slip episodes. By promoting shallow, sluggish subglacial water flow and low effective pressure, soft beds may help sustain themselves by slowing their own transport. Soft-bed shear resistance, kinematics and continuity are problems rooted in subglacial hydrology.},

abstract = {A ring-shear device was used to study the factors that control the ultimate(steady) strength of till at high shear strains.Tests at a steady strain rate and at different stresses normal to the shearing direction yielded ultimate friction angles of 26.3° and 18.6° for tills containing 4{\%} and 30{\%} clay-sized particles, respectively Other tests at steady normal stresses and variable shear-strain rates indicated a tendency for both tills to weaken slightly with increasing strain rate. This weakening may be due to small increases in till porosity.These results provide no evidence of viscous behavior and suggest that a Coulomb-plastic idealization is reasonable for till deformation. However, viscous behavior has often been suggested on the basis of distributed shear strain observed in subglacial till. We hypothesize that deformation may become distributed in till that is deformed cyclically in response to fluctuations in basal water pressure. During a deformation event, transient dilation of discrete shear zones should cause a reduction in internal pore-water pressure that should strengthen these zones relative to the surrounding till, a process called dilatant hardening. Consequent changes in shear-zone position, when integrated over time, may yield the observed distributed strain.},

abstract = {Experimental work in glacial geomorphology is focused almost entirely on processes in the thin shear zone at the beds of sliding glaciers, where ice at its pressure-melting temperature moves over either rigid rock or deformable till. Experiments with rotary shear devices illuminate constitutive behavior there, central to the dynamics of fast-moving glaciers, and provide a foundation for interpreting the sedimentary record of glacier slip and associated sediment transport. Results from experiments designed to study ice sliding over a rigid wavy bed, shear deformation of till, and plowing of clasts across the surface of a till bed point to a common conclusion: drag at the bed can decrease with increasing slip velocity, thereby concentrating driving stress elsewhere and promoting rapid glacier flow. This rate-weakening behavior at glacier beds is in contrast to the viscous slip resistance assumed in ice-sheet models and most efforts to determine distributions of basal drag from glacier surface velocities. Ring-shear experiments in which various basal tills and more idealized materials are sheared to high strains provide quantitative insight into grain size evolution, mixing at contacts between basal tills, microstructure development, particle-fabric development, and development of anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility. Preferred orientations of principal magnetic susceptibilities provide the most dependable and complete description of till shear patterns. When applied to basal tills of the geologic record, magnetic till fabrics measured along thick till sections and calibrated experimentally indicate that deformation of the bed by two lobes of the Laurentide ice sheet was shallow ({\textless}. 1. m), patchy, and occurred as till progressively accreted. Rates of sediment transport by bed shear were thus significantly less than estimates based on models that invoke deep, pervasive shear of the bed. The lack of an experimental tradition in glacial geomorphology leaves many research avenues open for exploration but also increases the challenge of demonstrating the relevance of experimental results to theoretical and field-based studies.},

abstract = {The annual cycle and secular trend of Greenland mass loading are well recorded in measurements of solid Earth deformation. Horizontal crustal displacements can potentially track the spatiotemporal detail of mass changes with great fidelity. Our analysis of Greenland crustal motion data reveals that a significant excitation of horizontal amplitudes occurs during the intense melt years. We discover that solitary seasonal waves of substantial mass transport (1.67 ± 0.54 Gt/month) traveled at an average speed of 7.1 km/month through Rink Glacier in 2012. We deduce that intense surface melting enhanced either basal lubrication or softening of shear margins, or both, causing the glacier to thin dynamically in summer. The newly routed upstream subglacial water was likely to be both retarded and inefficient, thus providing a causal mechanism for the prolonged ice transport to continue well into the winter months. As the climate continues to produce increasingly warmer spring and summer, amplified seasonal waves of mass transport may become ever more present with important ramifications for the future sea level rise. Plain Language Summary It has become well known that seasonal ice flow variability of Greenland outlet glaciers may often be associated with the drainage of supraglacial lakes that accumulate meltwater during summer. However, tracking the details is inevitably limited due to the fact that the mechanisms and rates of meltwater transfer are hidden from view, and theoretical models are fraught with a number of difficulties. Here we use a previously unrecognized source of data that constrain the mass transport during a season of intense Greenland melting and document the evolution of a mass transport wave as it passes down glacier. The breakthrough is twofold: demonstration of the power of the new technique and the first measurement of the mass amplitude. The technique is effectively using the measurement of the deformed solid Earth elastic response as a filter that uniquely responds to neighboring glacier mass changes. We quantify that the wave through Rink Glacier is enormous in terms of its mass transport, amounting to about half of the average annual discharge during 2000–2005, and travels at an average speed of 7.1 km/month. Our mass transport wave measurement is the first of its kind, on any of the major outlet glaciers of either Greenland or Antarctica.},

After a brief consideration of both how we choose reviewers and why we hope that reviewers will accept, I consider what makes a fair and constructive review. I note that we aim to publish papers with the rigour (r) necessary to sustain an original and significant contribution (q). I note that judging q is increasingly difficult because of the ever-growing size of the discipline (the Q). This is the sense in which we rarely have a full appreciation of Q, and our reviews are inevitably going to contain some bias. It is this bias that cannot be avoided (cf. Nicholas and Gordon, 2011) and makes the job of ESPL's Editors of critical importance. With this in mind, I identify six elements of a good review: (1) an introductory statement that explains your assessment of your competences in relation to the manuscript (r and Q); (2) a summative view of the originality and significance of the manuscript (q) in relation to Q: (3) a summative view of the methodological rigour of the manuscript (r); (4) identification and justification of any major concerns; (5) identification of any minor issues to be corrected if you think the manuscript merits eventual publication; and (6) note of any typographical or presentation issues to be addressed although this latter activity is also an editorial responsibility. In addition, I note the importance of a constructive review, grounded in what is written in the manuscript, justified where appropriate and avoiding reference to personal views as far as is possible. I conclude with a discussion of whether or not you should sign your review openly and the importance of reviewer confidentiality. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {High-resolution topographic surveying is traditionally associated with high capital and logistical costs, so that data acquisition is often passed on to specialist third party organisations. The high costs of data collection are, for many applications in the earth sciences, exacerbated by the remoteness and inaccessibility of many field sites, rendering cheaper, more portable surveying platforms (i.e. terrestrial laser scanning or GPS) impractical. This paper outlines a revolutionary, low-cost, user-friendly photogrammetric technique for obtaining high-resolution datasets at a range of scales, termed 'Structure-from-Motion' (SfM). Traditional softcopy photogrammetric methods require the 3-D location and pose of the camera(s), or the 3-D location of ground control points to be known to facilitate scene triangulation and reconstruction. In contrast, the SfM method solves the camera pose and scene geometry simultaneously and automatically, using a highly redundant bundle adjustment based on matching features in multiple overlapping, offset images. A comprehensive introduction to the technique is presented, followed by an outline of the methods used to create high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) from extensive photosets obtained using a consumer-grade digital camera. As an initial appraisal of the technique, an SfM-derived DEM is compared directly with a similar model obtained using terrestrial laser scanning. This intercomparison reveals that decimetre-scale vertical accuracy can be achieved using SfM even for sites with complex topography and a range of land-covers. Example applications of SfM are presented for three contrasting landforms across a range of scales including; an exposed rocky coastal cliff; a breached moraine-dam complex; and a glacially-sculpted bedrock ridge. The SfM technique represents a major advancement in the field of photogrammetry for geoscience applications. Our results and experiences indicate SfM is an inexpensive, effective, and flexible approach to capturing complex topography. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract. In north-western Tibet (34.0°N, 82.2°E) near lake Aru Co, the entire ablation areas of two glaciers (Aru-1 and Aru-2) suddenly collapsed on 17 July and 21 September 2016. The masses transformed into ice avalanches with volumes of 68 and 83×106m3 and ran out up to 7km in horizontal distance, killing nine people. The only similar event currently documented is the 130×106m3 Kolka Glacier rock and ice avalanche of 2002 (Caucasus Mountains). Using climatic reanalysis, remote sensing, and three-dimensional thermo-mechanical modelling, we reconstructed the Aru glaciers' thermal regimes, thicknesses, velocities, basal shear stresses, and ice damage prior to the collapse in detail. Thereby, we highlight the potential of using emergence velocities to constrain basal friction in mountain glacier models. We show that the frictional change leading to the Aru collapses occurred in the temperate areas of the polythermal glaciers and is not related to a rapid thawing of cold-based ice. The two glaciers experienced a similar stress transfer from predominant basal drag towards predominant lateral shearing in the detachment areas and during the 5–6 years before the collapses. A high-friction patch is found under the Aru-2 glacier tongue, but not under the Aru-1 glacier. This difference led to disparate behaviour of both glaciers, making the development of the instability more visible for the Aru-1 glacier through enhanced crevassing and terminus advance over a longer period. In comparison, these signs were observable only over a few days to weeks (crevasses) or were absent (advance) for the Aru-2 glacier. Field investigations reveal that those two glaciers were underlain by soft, highly erodible, and fine-grained sedimentary lithologies. We propose that the specific bedrock lithology played a key role in the two Tibet and the Caucasus Mountains giant glacier collapses documented to date by producing low bed roughness and large amounts of till, rich in clay and silt with a low friction angle. The twin 2016 Aru collapses would thus have been driven by a failing basal substrate linked to increasing pore water pressure in the subglacial drainage system in response to increases in surface melting and rain during the 5–6 years preceding the collapse dates.},

abstract = {Assessing risks from potential glacier hazards in relation to safety considerations for settlements and other fixed installations in high mountain areas requires the application of experience gained from previous events, combined with simple rules derived from basic glaciological theory. The general characteristics of steep, and usually unmeasured, glaciers can be estimated on the basis of a rough parameterization scheme. Variations in glacier length, ice avalanches, and glacier floods then have to be considered for time periods ranging from a few years up to a few decades. As a result of such systematic assessments, maps of potentially dangerous zones can be prepared. Although the inhabitants of many Alpine villages have always lived with the risk of glacier hazards, it now appears that modern construction work, especially that connected with the development of tourism, has started to infiltrate previously avoided high-risk zones more and more. In order to plan reasonable safety measures, risks from glacier hazards have to be compared with those from other natural hazards in mountain areas, such as snow avalanches, landslides, rock falls! or storm-induced floods. Decisions about the acceptable level of risk are difficult and subjective; they are also often influenced by political and economical considerations rather than by scientific reasoning.},

abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim) has been downscaled using a regional model covering Alaska at 20-km spatial and hourly temporal resolution for 1979-2013. Stakeholders can utilize these enhanced-resolution data to investigate climate- and weather-related phenomena in Alaska. Temperature and precipitation are analyzed and compared among ERA-Interim, WRF Model downscaling, and in situ observations. Relative to ERA-Interim, the downscaling is shown to improve the spatial representation of temperature and precipitation around Alaska's complex terrain. Improvements include increased winter and decreased summer higher-elevation downscaled seasonal average temperatures. Precipitation is also enhanced over higher elevations in all seasons relative to the reanalysis. These spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation are consistent with the few available gridded observational datasets that account for topography. The downscaled precipitation generally exceeds observationally derived estimates in all seasons over mainland Alaska, and it is less than observations in the southeast. Temperature biases tended to be more mixed, and the downscaling reduces absolute bias at higher elevations, especially in winter. Careful selection of data for local site analysis from the downscaling can help to reduce these biases, especially those due to inconsistencies in elevation. Improved meteorological station coverage at higher elevations will be necessary to better evaluate gridded downscaled products in Alaska because biases vary and may even change sign with elevation.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Author(s) In the USA, climate change is expected to have an adverse impact on slope stability in Alaska. However, to date, there has been limited work done in Alaska to assess if changes in slope stability are occurring. To address this issue, we used 30-m Landsat imagery acquired from 1984 to 2016 to establish an inventory of 24 rock avalanches in a 5000-km 2 area of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska. A search of available earthquake catalogs revealed that none of the avalanches were triggered by earthquakes. Analyses of rock-avalanche magnitude, mobility, and frequency reveal a cluster of large (areas ranging from 5.5 to 22.2 km 2 ), highly mobile (height/length {\textless} 0.3) rock avalanches that occurred from June 2012 through June 2016 (near the end of the 33-year period of record). These rock avalanches began about 2 years after the long-term trend in mean annual maximum air temperature may have exceeded 0 °C. Possibly more important, most of these rock avalanches occurred during a multiple-year period of record-breaking warm winter and spring air temperatures. These observations suggested to us that rock avalanches in the study area may be becoming larger because of rock-permafrost degradation. However, other factors, such as accumulating elastic strain, glacial thinning, and increased precipitation, may also play an important role in preconditioning slopes for failure during periods of warm temperatures.},

abstract = {This book is one out of 8 IAEG XII Congress volumes, and deals with the preservation of cultural heritage. In 1972, the World Heritage Convention linked in a single framework the concepts of nature conservation and the preservation of cultural sites. Since then, engineering geology is enlarging its contributions to national and international projects on this topic and is extending its interests to key issues like: safeguarding of monuments and sites from geotechnical perspectives; advanced monitoring; investigations on cultural landscapes; development of geo-databases for cultural heritage classification; studies on the interactions between humankind, natural landscape evolution and cultural heritage; analysis of weathering and deterioration of rock properties of monuments; risk analysis of sites affected by natural hazards and many others. With the contributions in this book, engineering geologists, conservation scientists and further experts from other natural, social and economic sciences, as well as representatives of international organizations and national and local administrative authorities exchange their ideas and practices on culture heritage preservation by presenting both local case studies and multidisciplinary international projects. The Engineering Geology for Society and Territory volumes of the IAEG XII Congress held in Torino from September 15-19, 2014, analyze the dynamic role of engineering geology in our changing world and build on the four main themes of the congress: Environment, processes, issues and approaches. The congress topics and subject areas of the 8 IAEG XII Congress volumes are: Climate Change and Engineering Geology. Landslide Processes. River Basins, Reservoir Sedimentation and Water Resources. Marine and Coastal Processes. Urban Geology, Sustainable Planning and Landscape Exploitation. Applied Geology for Major Engineering Projects. Education, Professional Ethics and Public Recognition of Engineering Geology. Preservation of Cultural Heritage.},

@article{Gruber2007,
abstract = {Permafrost in steep bedrock is abundant in many cold-mountain areas, and its degradation can cause slope instability that is unexpected and unprecedented in location, magnitude, frequency, and timing. These phenomena bear consequences for the understanding of landscape evolution, natural hazards, and the safe and sustainable operation of high-mountain infrastructure. Permafrost in steep bedrock is an emerging field of research. Knowledge of rock temperatures, ice content, mechanisms of degradation, and the processes that link warming and destabilization is often fragmental. In this article we provide a review and discussion of existing literature and pinpoint important questions. Ice-filled joints are common in bedrock permafrost and possibly actively widened by ice segregation. Broad evidence of destabilization by warming permafrost exists despite problems of attributing individual events to this phenomenon with certainty. Convex topography such as ridges, spurs, and peaks is often subject to faster and deeper thaw than other areas. Permafrost degradation in steep bedrock can be strongly affected by percolating water in fractures. This degradation by advection is difficult to predict and can lead to quick and deep development of thaw corridors along fractures in permafrost and potentially destabilize much greater volumes of rock than conduction would. Although most research on steep bedrock permafrost originates from the Alps, it will likely gain importance in other geographic regions with mountain permafrost.},

abstract = {Image-to-image cross-correlation software is applied to pairs of digital satellite images to map the velocity field of moving ice. This technique uses small-scale glacial surface features, such as crevasse scars and snow dunes, as markers on the surface of the moving ice. Displacements of the surface features are mapped by selecting small image areas centered on distinct features, or by dividing a large area of densely featured glacial surface into a grid of areas, and searching a subsequent image for matching areas using a cross-correlation algorithm. Interpolation of the peak correlation values allows the displacements to be measured to subpixel accuracy, resulting in very precise velocity measurements. Cross-correlation is also applied to provide image coregistration in areas devoid of bedrock exposures. In such areas, subtle large-scale topographic undulations in the ice surface, related to underlying bedrock structure, may be correlated by using large image areas and low-pass filtered images. Both types of applications are demonstrated, using Ice Stream D and Ice Stream E in West Antarctica as test areas. A high-resolution map of the velocity field of the central portion of Ice Stream E, generated by the displacement-measuring technique, is presented. The use of cross-correlation software is a significant improvement over previous manually-based photogrammetric methods for velocity measurement, and is far more cost-effective than in situ methods in remote polar areas.},

abstract = {Recent observations of changes in some tundra ecosystems appear to be responses to a warming climate. Several experimental studies have shown that tundra plants and ecosystems can respond strongly to environmental change, including warming; however, most studies were limited to a single location and were of short duration and based on a variety of experimental designs. In addition, comparisons among studies are difficult because a variety of techniques have been used to achieve experimental warming and different measurements have been used to assess responses. We used metaanalysis on plant community measurements from standardized warming experiments at 11 locations across the tundra biome involved in the International Tundra Experiment. The passive warming treatment increased plant-level air temperature by 1-3 degrees C, which is in the range of predicted and observed warming for tundra regions. Responses were rapid and detected in whole plant communities after only two growing seasons. Overall, warming increased height and cover of deciduous shrubs and graminoids, decreased cover of mosses and lichens, and decreased species diversity and evenness. These results predict that warming will cause a decline in biodiversity across a wide variety of tundra, at least in the short term.

These changes have important implications for processes and interactions within tundra ecosystems and between tundra and the atmosphere.},

Here we synthesize field data from arctic Alaska, showing that terrestrial changes in summer albedo contribute substantially to recent high-latitude warming trends. Pronounced terrestrial summer warming in arctic Alaska correlates with a lengthening of the snow-free season that has increased atmospheric heating locally by about 3 watts per square meter per decade (similar in magnitude to the regional heating expected over multiple decades from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). The continuation of current trends in shrub and tree expansion could further amplify this atmospheric heating by two to seven times.},

Pinatubo in June 1991. The average May to September normalized difference vegetation index from 45 degrees N to 75 degrees N increased by 9{\%} from 1982 to 1991, decreased by 5{\%} from 1991 to 1992, and increased by 8{\%} from 1992 to 1999. Variations in the normalized difference vegetation index were associated with variations in the start of the growing season of -5.6, +3.9, and -1.7 days respectively, for the three time periods. Our results support surface temperature increases within the same period at higher northern latitudes where temperature limits plant growth.},

abstract = {Variations in the amplitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 have shown an association with surface air temperature consistent with the hypothesis that warmer temperatures have promoted increases in plant growth during summer(1) and/or plant respiration during winter(2) in the northern high latitudes. Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45 degrees N and 70 degrees N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time(3) due to an early disappearance of snow(4). The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20{\%} since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer(1). Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant.},

abstract = {Assessing potential future changes in arctic and boreal plant species productivity, ecosystem composition, and canopy complexity is essential for understanding environmental responses under expected altered climate forcing. We examined potential changes in the dominant plant functional types (PFTs) of the sedge tundra, shrub tundra, and boreal forest ecosystems in ecotonal northern Alaska, USA, for the years 2003-2100. We compared energy feedbacks associated with increases in biomass to energy feedbacks associated with changes in the duration of the snow-free season. We based our simulations on nine input climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that incorporates biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics for multiple PFTs (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses, sedges, mosses), multiple vegetation pools, and soil thermal regimes. We found mean increases in net primary productivity (NPP) in all PFTs. Most notably, birch (Betula spp.) in the shrub tundra showed increases that were at least three times larger than any other PFT. Increases in NPP were positively related to increases in growing-season length in the sedge tundra, but PFTs in boreal forest and shrub tundra showed a significant response to changes in light availability as well as growing-season length. Significant NPP responses to changes in vegetation uptake of nitrogen by PFT indicated that some PFTs were better competitors for nitrogen than other PFTs. While NPP increased, heterotrophic respiration (RH) also increased, resulting in decreases or no change in net ecosystem carbon uptake. Greater aboveground biomass from increased NPP produced a decrease in summer albedo, greater regional heat absorption (0.34 +/- 0.23 W x m(-2) x 10 yr(-1) [mean +/- SD]), and a positive feedback to climate warming. However, the decrease in albedo due to a shorter snow season (-5.1 +/- 1.6 d/10 yr) resulted in much greater regional heat absorption (3.3 +/- 1.24 W x m(-2) x 10 yr(-1)) than that associated with increases in vegetation. Through quantifying feedbacks associated with changes in vegetation and those associated with changes in the snow season length, we can reach a more integrated understanding of the manner in which climate change may impact interactions between high-latitude ecosystems and the climate system.},

abstract = {Arctic climate is projected to change dramatically in the next 100 years and increases in temperature will likely lead to changes in the distribution and makeup of the Arctic biosphere. A largely deciduous ecosystem has been suggested as a possible landscape for future Arctic vegetation and is seen in paleo-records of warm times in the past. Here we use a global climate model with an interactive terrestrial biosphere to investigate the effects of adding deciduous trees on bare ground at high northern latitudes. We find that the top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance from enhanced transpiration (associated with the expanded forest cover) is up to 1.5 times larger than the forcing due to albedo change from the forest. Furthermore, the greenhouse warming by additional water vapor melts sea-ice and triggers a positive feedback through changes in ocean albedo and evaporation. Land surface albedo change is considered to be the dominant mechanism by which trees directly modify climate at high-latitudes, but our findings suggest an additional mechanism through transpiration of water vapor and feedbacks from the ocean and sea-ice.},

@article{Nemani2003,
abstract = {Recent climatic changes have enhanced plant growth in northern mid-latitudes and high latitudes. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impact of global climatic changes on vegetation productivity has not before been expressed in the context of variable limiting factors to plant growth. We present a global investigation of vegetation responses to climatic changes by analyzing 18 years (1982 to 1999) of both climatic data and satellite observations of vegetation activity. Our results indicate that global changes in climate have eased several critical climatic constraints to plant growth, such that net primary production increased 6{\%} (3.4 petagrams of carbon over 18 years) globally. The largest increase was in tropical ecosystems. Amazon rain forests accounted for 42{\%} of the global increase in net primary production, owing mainly to decreased cloud cover and the resulting increase in solar radiation.},

@article{Lucht2002,
abstract = {A biogeochemical model of vegetation using observed climate data predicts the high northern latitude greening trend over the past two decades observed by satellites and a marked setback in this trend after the Mount Pinatubo volcano eruption in 1991. The observed trend toward earlier spring budburst and increased maximum leaf area is produced by the model as a consequence of biogeochemical vegetation responses mainly to changes in temperature. The post-Pinatubo decline in vegetation in 1992-1993 is apparent as the effect of temporary cooling caused by the eruption. High-latitude CO(2) uptake during these years is predicted as a consequence of the differential response of heterotrophic respiration and net primary production.},

@book{Gutman2010,
abstract = {This volume is a compilation of studies on interactions of land-cover/land-use change with climate in a region where the climate warming is most pronounced compared to other areas of the globe. The climate warming in the far North, and in the Arctic region of Northern Eurasia in particular, affects both the landscape and human activities, and hence human dimensions are an important aspect of the topic. Environmental pollution together with climate warming may produce irreversible damages to the current Arctic ecosystems. Regional land-atmosphere feedbacks may have large global importance. Remote sensing is a primary tool in studying vast northern territories where in situ observations are sporadic. State-of-the-art methods of satellite remote sensing combined with GIS and models are used to tackle science questions and provide an outlook of current land-cover changes and potential scenarios for the future. Audience: The book is a truly international effort involving U.S. and European scientists. It is directed at the broad science community including graduate students, academics and other professionals in this field.},
