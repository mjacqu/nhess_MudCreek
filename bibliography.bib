  abstract = {Reliable multi-temporal landslide detection over longer periods of time requires multi-sensor time series data characterized by high internal geometric stability, as well as high relative and absolute accuracy. For this purpose, a new methodology for fully automated co-registration has been developed allowing efficient and robust spatial alignment of standard orthorectified data products originating from a multitude of optical satellite remote sensing data of varying spatial resolution. Correlation-based co-registration uses world-wide available terrain corrected Landsat Level 1T time series data as the spatial reference, ensuring global applicability. The developed approach has been applied to a multi-sensor time series of 592 remote sensing datasets covering an approximately 12,000 km2 area in Southern Kyrgyzstan (Central Asia) strongly affected by landslides. The database contains images acquired during the last 26 years by Landsat (E)TM, ASTER, SPOT and RapidEye sensors. Analysis of the spatial shifts obtained from co-registration has revealed sensor-specific alignments ranging between 5 m and more than 400 m. Overall accuracy assessment of these alignments has resulted in a high relative image-to-image accuracy of 17 m (RMSE) and a high absolute accuracy of 23 m (RMSE) for the whole co-registered database, making it suitable for multi-temporal landslide detection at a regional scale in Southern Kyrgyzstan.},

  abstract = {In the past, different approaches for automated landslide identification based on multispectral satellite remote sensing were developed to focus on the analysis of the spatial distribution of landslide occurrences related to distinct triggering events. However, many regions, including southern Kyrgyzstan, experience ongoing process activity requiring continual multi-temporal analysis. For this purpose, an automated object-oriented landslide mapping approach has been developed based on RapidEye time series data complemented by relief information. The approach builds on analyzing temporal NDVI-trajectories for the separation between landslide-related surface changes and other land cover changes. To accommodate the variety of landslide phenomena occurring in the 7500 km2 study area, a combination of pixel-based multiple thresholds and object-oriented analysis has been implemented including the discrimination of uncertainty-related landslide likelihood classes. Applying the approach to the whole study area for the time period between 2009 and 2013 has resulted in the multi-temporal identification of 471 landslide objects. A quantitative accuracy assessment for two independent validation sites has revealed overall high mapping accuracy (Quality Percentage: 80\%), proving the suitability of the developed approach for efficient spatiotemporal landslide mapping over large areas, representing an important prerequisite for objective landslide hazard and risk assessment at the regional scale.},

The presented technique is based on an appropriate combination of differential interferograms produced by data pairs characterized by a small orbital separation (baseline) in order to limit the spatial decorrelation phenomena. The application of the singular value decomposition method allows us to easily ``link'' independent SAR acquisition datasets, separated by large baselines, thus increasing the observation temporal sampling rate. The availability of both spatial and temporal information in the processed data is used to identify and filter out atmospheric phase artifacts. We present results obtained on the data acquired from 1992 to 2000 by the European Remote Sensing satellites and relative to the Campi Flegrei caldera and to the city of Naples, Italy that demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach to follow the dynamics of the detected deformations.},

  abstract = {Following a large continental earthquake, information on the spatial distribution of triggered landslides is required as quickly as possible for use in emergency response coordination. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) methods have the potential to overcome variability in weather conditions, which often causes delays of days or weeks when mapping landslides using optical satellite imagery. Here we test landslide classifiers based on SAR coherence, which is estimated from the similarity in phase change in time between small ensembles of pixels. We test two existing SAR-coherence-based landslide classifiers against an independent inventory of landslides triggered following the Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake, and present and test a new method, which uses a classifier based on coherence calculated from ensembles of neighbouring pixels and coherence calculated from a more dispersed ensemble of `sibling' pixels. Using Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis, we show that none of these three SAR-coherence-based landslide classification methods are suitable for mapping individual landslides on a pixel-by-pixel basis. However, they show potential in generating lower-resolution density maps, which are used by emergency responders following an earthquake to coordinate large-scale operations and identify priority areas. The new method we present outperforms existing methods when tested at these lower resolutions, suggesting that it may be able to provide useful and rapid information on landslide distributions following major continental earthquakes.},

But to understand why glaciers are so inexorably tied to global warming and why people lament the loss of ice, it is necessary to look beyond climate science and glacier melting?to turn additionally to culture, history, and power relations. Probing historical views of glaciers demonstrates that the recent emergence of an "endangered glacier" narrative stemmed from various glacier perspectives dating to the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries: glaciers as menace, scientific laboratories, sublime scenery, recreation sites, places to explore and conquer, and symbols of wilderness. By encompassing so many diverse meanings, glacier and global warming discourse can thus offer a platform to implement historical ideologies about nature, science, imperialism, race, recreation, wilderness, and global power dynamics.},

  abstract = {In the evening of February 28, 2004, a landslide took place in the village of Rossena (Northern Apennines, Italy), built at the base of a crag shaped in a basalt mass and wrapped in highly deformed formation of clay and shale with blocks. The failure damaged some houses, roads and fields but, fortunately, the medieval Rossena Castle, lying on the crag, was not involved at all. The goal of the study was to attain a technical and geological model of the slope to generate a landslide risk zonation, for regularity and development planning, so that the most correct action plans could be proposed. A detailed geological and geomorphological survey allowed for distinguishing the different gravitative landform of this area. It was very helpful to plan direct and indirect investigation, including borehole drillings, samplings, seismic (tomography), and electrical surveys. A monitoring system was built up immediately after the event (three wire extensometers and one inclinometer), then progressively substituted by a more complete one (two tiltmeters, two jointmeters, four inclinometers, two incremental extensometers, and two piezometers). The phenomenon can be divided in different parts. The central sector of the slope is interested by compound slides likely affecting the bedrock and can be considered, at present, the `engine' of the whole instability framework. Indeed, as a consequence, in the upper portion of the slope the huge blocks in which the outer part of the crag is disjointed experienced vertical displacements and, locally, topplings. Finally, the lowest sector is affected by slow movements, probably connected to bedrock creep or rock flow, while the toe, really at the foot of the slope, by shallow landslides. This instability framework is the result of a complex evolution, starting almost more than 9,000 years ago, as testified from a radiocarbon dating. In more recent time (19th century), the Rossena landslide was also triggered by an earthquake that induced the partially breaking up of the crag, causing rock falls and cracks in the ground.},

While challenging even in the best of circumstances, this problem poses unique difficulties when the dimensions of the interferometric input data exceed the limits of one's computational capabilities. In order to deal with such cases, we propose a technique for applying the statistical-cost, network-flow phase-unwrapping algorithm (SNAPHU) of Chen and Zebker to large datasets. Specifically, we introduce a methodology whereby a large interferogram is partitioned into a set of several smaller tiles that are unwrapped individually and then divided further into independent, irregularly shaped reliable regions. These regions are subsequently assembled into a full unwrapped solution, with the phase offsets between regions computed in a secondary optimization problem whose objective is to maximize the a posteriori probability of the final solution. As this secondary problem assumes the same statistical models as employed in the initial tile-unwrapping stage, the technique results in a solution that approximates the solution that would have been obtained had the full-size interferogram been unwrapped as a single piece. The secondary problem is framed in terms of network-flow ideas, allowing the use of an existing nonlinear solver. Applying the algorithm to a large topographic interferogram acquired over central Alaska, we find that the technique is less prone to unwrapping artifacts than more simple tiling approaches.},

The introduced models are either intensity or interferometric models, and there is no single scattering model that can estimate both intensity and phase changes, indicating the subject is poorly understood. Here, we quantify the influence of soil moisture on InSAR phase and SAR intensity by employing a volume scattering model. We model soil as a collection of randomly distributed independent point scatterers embedded in a homogeneous background. Our volume scattering model successfully estimates SAR intensity and InSAR phase changes due to soil moisture changes. In addition to soil moisture changes, the model also takes into account the scatterers' size and their volumetric fraction. This may open a new window in the study of soil structure using SAR images and InSAR methods. Our results indicate that the structure of soil manipulates the way soil moisture alters the SAR intensity and InSAR phase. The model has been evaluated against field soil moisture measurements and shown to be successful in modeling InSAR phase and SAR intensity.},

This paper proposes some methods for characterizing complex volumetric environments using polarimetric SAR tomography, a 3-D imaging technique based on the use of diversely polarized electromagnetic waves acquired from different trajectories. The use of polarimetric diversity permits to both improve the tomographic separation between different components of complex volumetric media and to characterize the EM behavior of the observed environments. A set of spectral estimation techniques, adapted to tomographic focusing, are tested against signal models accounting for the statistical complexity of hybrid volumetric environments. Due to their statistical adaptivity, their robustness to mismodeling and their accuracy, spectral estimators based on weighted subspace fitting criteria are selected and extended to the polarimetric case. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is assessed over real data and for three different applications, related to urban area 3-D mapping using a minimal set of images, tropical forest structure characterization using low frequency waves, and under-foliage concealed vehicle imaging.},

Stereoscopic satellite images can also be interpreted visually to recognize and map landslides. When interpreting stereoscopic imagery, shadows can conceal the photographic elements typical of landslides, hampering the recognition and mapping of the landslides. To mitigate the problem, we propose a method that exploits normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images and digital stereoscopy for the 3D visual recognition and mapping of landslides in shadowed areas. We tested the method in the 25 km2 Pogliaschina catchment, northern Italy, where intense rainfall caused abundant landslides on 25 October 2011. Using a PLANAR\textregistered{} StereoMirror\texttrademark{} digital stereoscope, we prepared an event landslide inventory map (E-LIM) through the visual interpretation of a pair of NDVI images obtained from a WorldView-2 stereoscopic multispectral bundle. We compared the event inventory with two independent E-LIMs for the same area and landslide event. The 3D vision of the NDVI stereoscopic image pair maximized the use of the radiometric (color and tone) and the terrain (elevation, slope, relief, and convexity) information captured by the stereoscopic multispectral images, allowing for the recognition of more landslides and more landslide areas than the other E-LIMs in the shadowed areas. Our results confirm that use of NDVI images facilitates the visual recognition and mapping of landslides in terrain affected by shadows. We expect that the proposed method can help trained interpreters to map landslides more accurately in areas affected by shadows.},

In the last few years, new GPS methods have been developed (among them, the fast-static and real time kinematic), with higher productivity and good theoretical precision. The main objective of this paper is to ascertain the performance of these methods in landslide monitoring practice. We present, first of all, the basic principles of the GPS, the equipment and working procedures. We discuss afterwards the applicability of the GPS to the monitoring of landslide surface displacements. Compared with the classical surveying methods, the GPS allows a larger coverage and productivity with similar accuracy. Furthermore, it can work in all kinds of weather conditions and a direct line of sight between stations is not required. Finally, we present an example of the performance of the GPS equipment in the landslide of Vallcebre, Eastern Pyrenees (Spain). This landslide has been periodically monitored since 1987 with terrestrial photogrammetry and geodetic measurements [theodolite, electronic distance metres ( EDM )]. The movement extends over an area of 0.8 km2 and has experienced displacements as large as 1.6 m during the period 1996\textendash 1997. 14 campaigns, over a period of 26 months, using both static and kinematic GPS methods have been carried out. The GPS measurements have been compared with the results obtained with the EDM, inclinometers and wire extensometers, and checked against fixed stable points. The precision achieved with the GPS measurements is 12 to 16 mm in the horizontal plane and 18 to 24 mm in elevation. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Landslides are present in all continents, and play an important role in the evolution of landscapes. They also represent a serious hazard in many areas of the world. Despite their importance, we estimate that landslide maps cover less than 1\% of the slopes in the landmasses, and systematic information on the type, abundance, and distribution of landslides is lacking. Preparing landslide maps is important to document the extent of landslide phenomena in a region, to investigate the distribution, types, pattern, recurrence and statistics of slope failures, to determine landslide susceptibility, hazard, vulnerability and risk, and to study the evolution of landscapes dominated by mass-wasting processes. Conventional methods for the production of landslide maps rely chiefly on the visual interpretation of stereoscopic aerial photography, aided by field surveys. These methods are time consuming and resource intensive. New and emerging techniques based on satellite, airborne, and terrestrial remote sensing technologies, promise to facilitate the production of landslide maps, reducing the time and resources required for their compilation and systematic update. In this work, we first outline the principles for landslide mapping, and we review the conventional methods for the preparation of landslide maps, including geomorphological, event, seasonal, and multi-temporal inventories. Next, we examine recent and new technologies for landslide mapping, considering (i) the exploitation of very-high resolution digital elevation models to analyze surface morphology, (ii) the visual interpretation and semiautomatic analysis of different types of satellite images, including panchromatic, multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar images, and (iii) tools that facilitate landslide field mapping. Next, we discuss the advantages and the limitations of the new remote sensing data and technology for the production of geomorphological, event, seasonal, and multi-temporal inventory maps. We conclude by arguing that the new tools will help to improve the quality of landslide maps, with positive effects on all derivative products and analyses, including erosion studies and landscape modeling, susceptibility and hazard assessments, and risk evaluations.},

  abstract = {Precipitation drives seasonal velocity changes in slow-moving landslides by increasing pore-water pressure and reducing the effective normal stress along basal shear zones. This pressure change is often modeled as a pore-water pressure wave that diffuses through the landslide body, such that the minimum time required for landslides to respond to rainfall should vary as the square of landslide depth (which often approximates the saturated thickness) and inversely with hydraulic diffusivity. Here, we assess this model with new observations from the landslide-prone Eel River catchment, Northern California. Using satellite radar interferometry (InSAR) time series, precipitation data, and high-resolution topographic data from airborne lidar, we quantify the seasonal dynamics of 10 slow-moving landslides, which share the same lithologic, tectonic, and Mediterranean climate conditions. These slope failures have areas ranging from 0.16 to 3.1 km2, depths that vary from 8 to 40 m, and average downslope velocities of 0.2 to 1.2 m/yr. Each slide exhibits well-defined seasonal velocity changes with a periodicity of {$\sim$}1 yr and responds (i.e., accelerates) within 40 days following the onset of rainfall. Despite a five-fold variation in landslide depth, we do not detect systematic differences in response time within the resolution of our observations. Our results could imply that: 1) slides in our study area are sensitive to subtle hydrologic perturbations, 2) the `effective' diffusivity governing slide behavior is much higher than fieldderived values because pore pressure transmission and slide dynamics are facilitated by preferential flow paths, particularly cracks related to deformation and seasonal shrink-swell cycles, or 3) a simple onedimensional linear diffusion model may fail to capture the three-dimensional time-dependent hydrologic changes inherent in an evolving mechanical\textendash hydrologic system, such as a slow-moving landslide.},

  abstract = {Slow-moving landslides exhibit persistent downslope motion with variations in velocity driven by transient stress perturbations along the sliding surface. Here, we use satellite InSAR and high-resolution topographic data to identify 50 slow-moving landslides in the Northern California Coast Ranges, and monitor their seasonal kinematics over 4 years. These landslides have similar mechanical properties and are subject to the same external forcings, which allows us to explore geometrical controls on kinematics. To overcome errors associated with large deformation gradients we incorporate a deformation model in the InSAR processing that enables us to generate deformation time series. We test our novel methodology using a synthetic deformation time series, confirming our ability to resolve seasonal velocity patterns. Time series analysis of four representative landslides reveals that seasonal velocity changes are characterized by comparatively rapid acceleration and gradual deceleration. Each slide displays distinct kinematic zones with different mean velocities, although velocity changes appear to occur synchronously along the landslide body over seasonal timescales. Because these deformation patterns are sensitive to subsurface geometry, we employ a commonly used non-Newtonian viscous flow law to infer slide thickness and find that these slides likely exhibit a highly variable thickness and an irregular (i.e. rough and non-planar) basal sliding surface. Our results suggest that slide geometry controls long-term motion, but does not strongly regulate their response to seasonal stress perturbations.},

The main reason for undertaking this work, early 1995, was the fact that this technique proved to be extremely useful for wide-scale, fine-resolution deformation measurements. Especially the interf- ometric products from the ERS-1 satellite provided beautiful first results\textemdash several interferometric images appeared as highlights on the cover of journals such as Nature and Science. Accuracies of a few millimeters in the radar line of sight were claimed in semi-continuous image data acquired globally, irrespective of cloud cover or solar illumination. Unfortunately, because of the relative lack of supportive observations at these resolutions and accuracies, validation of the precision and reliability of the results remained an issue of concern. From a geodetic point of view, several survey techniques are commonly available to measure a specific geophysical phenomenon. To make an optimal choice between these techniques it is important to have a uniform and quantitative approach for describing the errors and how these errors propagate to the estimated parameters. In this context, the research described in this book was initiated. It describes issues involved with different types of errors, induced by the sensor, the data processing, satellite positioning accuracy, atmospheric propagation, and scattering character- tics. Nevertheless, as the first item in the subtitle ``Data Interpretation and Error Analysis'' suggests, data interpretation is not always straightforward.},

  abstract = {The mountain cryosphere, which includes glaciers, permafrost, and snow, is one of the Earth's systems most strongly affected by climate change. In recent decades, changes in the cryosphere have been well documented in many highmountain regions. While there are some benefits from snow and ice loss, the negative impacts, including from glacier lake outburst floods and variations in glacier runoff, are generally considered to far outweigh the positive impacts, particularly if cultural impacts are considered. In international climate policy, there has been growing momentum to address the negative impacts of climate change, or `Loss and Damage' (L\&D) from climate change. It is not clear exactly what can and should be done to tackle L\&D, but researchers and practitioners are beginning to engage with policy discussions and develop potential frameworks and supporting information. Despite the strong impact of climate change on the mountain cryosphere, there has been limited interaction between cryosphere researchers and L\&D. Therefore, little work has been done to consider how L\&D in the mountain cryosphere might be conceptualized, categorized, and assessed. Here, we make a first attempt to analyze L\&D in the mountain cryosphere by conducting a systematic literature review to extract L\&D impacts and examples from existing literature. We find that L\&D is a global phenomenon in the mountain cryosphere and has been more frequently documented in the developing world, both in relation with slow and sudden onset processes. We develop a categorization of L\&D, making distinctions between physical and societal impacts, primary and secondary impacts, and identifying seven types of L\&D (including L\&D to culture, livelihoods, revenue, natural resources, life, and security). We hope this conceptual approach will support future work to understand and address L\&D in the mountain cryosphere.},

  abstract = {The right-lateral San Gregorio-Hosgri fault system (SGHF) extends mainly offshore for about 400 km along the central California coast and is a major structure in the distributed transform margin of western North America. We mapped a poorly known 64-km-long section of the SGHF offshore Big Sur between Piedras Blancas and Point Sur using high-resolution bathymetry, seismic reflection, and marine magnetic data. In this region, the SGHF is characterized by multiple strands, step overs, scarps and lineaments, shutter ridges, deflected drainages, and other geomorphic features consistent with strike-slip faulting. Analysis of offset shelfbreak gullies suggest a lateral slip rate of about 3.35 mm/year. Vertical slip rates range as high as 0.8 to 1.2 mm/year. Lateral slip combined with high vertical slip rates result in a northwest decrease in shelf width, a northward increase in shelf and upper slope gradient, and progressive incision of submarine canyon heads. The SGHF between Point Sur and Piedras Blancas trends \textasciitilde 321\textdegree{} and forms a 105-km-long transpressive bend (the Big Sur Bend) between more north trending transtensional fault sections to the south (120 km long, \textasciitilde 336\textdegree{} trend) and north (180 km long, \textasciitilde 337\textdegree{} trend). This transpressional bend and SGHF splay faults have had a significant role in shaping the modern geomorphology of the central California coast, controlling or influencing the locations of mountainous uplifts, large coastal headlands, embayments, and rivers. Plain Language Summary The northwest trending Hosgri-San Gregorio fault zone extends along the central California coast for 400 km. We mapped a poorly known 64-km-long section of this important fault zone offshore of Big Sur between Piedras Blancas and Point Sur using high-resolution geophysical tools and methods. In this offshore region, surface and subsurface features indicate that the fault zone is active and is characterized by both right-lateral and vertical displacement. The northeast side of the fault is moving about 3.3 mm/year to the southeast as it is being uplifted about 0.8 mm/year. The Big Sur part of the fault zone forms a large bend between more northerly trending parts of the fault zone to the north and south. Fault movement through this Big Sur bend controls or influences locations of large coastal headlands, mountainous uplifts, rivers, and embayments.},

The coupled effect of major events and natural phenomena sometimes leads to misinterpretation of interferometric coherence maps and often degrades the performance of change detection algorithms. To differentiate decorrelation sources caused by natural changes from those caused by an event of interest, we formulated a temporal decorrelation model that accounts for the random motion of canopy elements, temporally correlated dielectric changes, and temporally uncorrelated dielectric changes of canopy and ground. The model parameters are extracted from the interferometric pairs associated with natural changes in canopy and ground using the proposed temporal decorrelation model. In addition, the cumulative distribution functions of the temporally uncorrelated model parameters, which are associated with natural changes in canopy and ground, are estimated from interferometric pairs acquired before the event. Model parameters are also extracted from interferometric SAR data acquired across the event and compared with the cumulative probabilities of natural changes in order to calculate the probability of a major event. Subsequently, pixels with cumulative probabilities greater than 75\% are marked as changed due to the event. A case study for detecting volcanic ash during the eruption of the Shinmoedake volcano in January 2011 was carried out using L-band Advanced Land Observation Satellite PALSAR data.},

In order to understand the characteristics of landslide (damage) detectors for low-coherence areas and find an alternative and complementary method, we designed the coherence difference, coherence normalized difference, log-ratio, intensity correlation difference, and normalized differences of the intensity correlation assuming limited availability of dataset, and also developed multi-temporal algorithms using the coherence, intensity, and intensity correlation. They were tested and evaluated using multiple polygons extracted from aerial photos. We were able to observe that the multi-temporal intensity correlation method has the potential to detect the landslides over the low coherence region and all types of land uses.},

Based on field observations and remote sensing of a deep-seated landslide, located at the present-day terminus of the Great Aletsch Glacier, we show that the spatiotemporal response of the landslide to glacier retreat is rapid, occurring within a decade. Our observations uniquely capture the critical period of increase in slope deformations, onset of failure, and show that measured displacements at the crown and toe regions of the landslide demonstrate a feedback mechanism between glacier ice reduction and response of the entire landslide body.

One of the most dangerous hazards related with rock slope failures are tsunamis that can lead to large loss of life. It is therefore very important to systematically identify potential unstable rock slopes. Traditional landslide monitoring techniques are expensive and time consuming. Differential satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is an invaluable tool for land displacement monitoring. Improved access to time series of satellite data has led to the development of several innovative multitemporal algorithms. Small baseline (SB) methods are based on combining and inverting a set of unwrapped interferograms that are computed with a small perpendicular baseline in order to reduce spatial phase decorrelation. Another well proven technique is the persistent scatterer interferometric method (PSI) that is based on analysis of persistent point targets. In this paper, we apply both approaches to study several rockslide sites in Troms County in the far north of Norway. Moreover, we take the opportunity to address the difference and similarities between the SB and the PSI multitemporal InSAR methods for displacement studies in rural terrain.},

About 140,000 m3 of unstable rock mass remained in place and might collapse partially or completely in the future. The instability showed clearly visible signs of movements along a tension crack since 1989 and accelerated creep with significant hydromechanical forcing since about 2006. Because the active rockslide at Preonzo threatened a large industrial facility and important transport routes located directly at the toe of the slope, an early warning system was installed in 2010. The thresholds for prealarm, general public alarm, and evacuation were derived from crack meter and total station monitoring data covering a period of about 10 years, supplemented with information from past failure events with similar predisposition. These thresholds were successfully applied to evacuate the industrial facility and to close important roads a few days before the catastrophic slope failure of May 15, 2012. The rock slope failure occurred in two events, exposing a compound rupture plane dipping 42\textdegree{} and generating deposits in the midslope portion with a travel angle of 39\textdegree. Three hours after the second rockslide, the fresh deposits became reactivated in a devastating debris avalanche that reached the foot of the slope but did not destroy any infrastructure. The final run-out distance of this combined rock collapse\textendash debris avalanche corresponded to the predictions made in the year 2004.},

In the late summer 2016, a sudden acceleration was reported at this location, with surface velocity rates passing from maximum values of 0.2 cm/day to 80 cm/day. A dense pattern of uphill-facing scarps and tension cracks formed within the instability and rock fall activity started to become very pronounced. This evolution of the rock mass may suggest that the most active portion of the slope could fail catastrophically. Here we discuss advantages and limitations of the use of spaceborne methods for hazard analyses and early warning by using the ESA Sentinels, and show that in critical scenarios they are often not sufficient to reliably interpret the evolution of surface deformation. The insights obtained from this case study are relevant for similar scenarios in the Alps and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {We present a method for the semi-automatic recognition and mapping of recent rainfall induced shallow landslides. The method exploits VHR panchromatic and HR multispectral satellite images, and was tested in a 9.4 km2 area in Sicily, Italy, where on 1 October 2009 a high intensity rainfall event caused shallow landslides, soil erosion, and inundation. Pre-event and post-event images of the study area taken by the QuickBird satellite, and information on the location and type of landslides obtained in the field and through the interpretation of post-event aerial photographs, were used to construct and validate a set of terrain classification models. The models classify each image element (pixel) based on the probability that the pixel contains (or does not contain) a new rainfall induced landslide. To construct and validate the models, a procedure in five steps was adopted. First, the pre-event and the post-event images were pan-sharpened, ortho-rectified, co-registered, and corrected for atmospheric disturbance. Next, variables describing changes between the pre-event and the post-event images attributed to landslide occurrence were selected. Next, three classification models were calibrated in a training area using different multivariate statistical techniques. The calibrated models were then applied in a validation area using the same set of independent variables, and the same statistical techniques. Lastly, combined terrain classification models were prepared for the training and the validation areas. The performances of the models were evaluated using four-fold plots and receiver operating characteristic curves. The method proved capable of detecting and mapping the new rainfall induced landslides in the study area. We expect the method to be capable of detecting analogous shallow landslides caused by similar (rainfall) or different (e.g. earthquake) triggers, provided that the event slope failures leave discernable features captured by the post-event satellite images, and that the terrain information and satellite images are of adequate quality. The proposed method can facilitate the rapid production of accurate landslide event-inventory maps, and we expect that it will improve our ability to map landslides consistently over large areas. Application of the method will advance our ability to evaluate landslide hazards, and will foster our understanding of the evolution of landscapes shaped by mass-wasting processes.},

Many countries around the world have recorded a decrease in deployment of physical infrastructure for hydrological measurements; developing countries especially have less of this infrastructure and, where it exists, it is poorly maintained. Satellite remote sensing can bridge this gap, and has been applied by hydrologists over the years, with the earliest applications in water body and flood mapping. With the availability of more optical satellites with relatively low temporal resolutions globally, satellite data are commonly used for mapping of water bodies, testing of inundation models, precipitation monitoring, and mapping of flood extent. Use of satellite data to estimate hydrological parameters continues to increase due to use of better sensors, improvement in knowledge of and utilization of satellite data, and expansion of research topics. A review of applications of satellite remote sensing in surface water modelling, mapping and parameter estimation is presented, and its limitations for surface water applications are also discussed.},

The observed signal is hypothesized to result from both changes in penetration depth and the swelling of clay-rich soils, both due to changes in soil moisture. Comparisons with our field measurements of soil moisture cannot conclusively verify this, but strong support is found from prior and complementary research as well as the visual correlation with hydrological features such as stream channels and watershed boundaries on a 50-m scale. Detection of these subtle signals was facilitated using a digital elevation model with high vertical accuracy. If our interpretations are correct, C-band DInSAR is a promising new tool for the remote sensing of soil moisture in a variety of terrain.},

Although interferometric SAR (InSAR) analysis is widely used to monitor landslides, it is difficult to use that for rapid landslide detection in mountainous forest areas because of significant decorrelation. We combined polarimetric SAR (PolSAR), InSAR, and digital elevation model (DEM) analysis to detect landslides induced by the July 2017 Heavy Rain in Northern Kyushu and by the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi Earthquake. This study uses fully polarimetric L-band SAR data from the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 satellite. The simple thresholding of polarimetric parameters (alpha angle and Pauli components) was found to be effective. The study also found that supervised classification using PolSAR, InSAR, and DEM parameters provided high accuracy, although this method should be used carefully because its accuracy depends on the geological characteristics of the training data. Regarding polarimetric configurations, at least dual-polarimetry (e.g., HH and HV) is required for landslide detection, and quad-polarimetry is recommended. These results demonstrate the feasibility of rapid landslide detection using L-band SAR images.},

Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to accurately assess the spatial and temporal variability of surface soil moisture using conventional, point measurement techniques. Remote sensing has the potential to provide areal estimates of soil moisture at a variety of spatial scales. This investigation evaluates the use of European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-2) C-band, VV polarization, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for regional estimates of surface soil moisture. Radar data were acquired for three contiguous ERS-2 scenes in the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of central Oklahoma from June 1999 to October 2000. Twelve test sites (each approximately 800 m6800 m) were sampled during the ERS-2 satellite overpasses in order to monitor changes in soil moisture and vegetation on the ground. An average radar backscattering coefficient was calculated for each test site. Landsat-5 and -7 Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the experimental sites close in time to the ERS-2 acquisition dates were also analysed. The TM scenes were used to monitor land cover changes and to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Land cover and ground data were used to interpret the radar-derived soil moisture data. Linear relationships between soil moisture and the backscattering coefficient were established. Using these equations, soil moisture maps of the Little Washita and the El Reno test areas were produced.},

These total numbers of landslides and victims are an order of magnitude greater than other data sets have indicated, but analysis of the data suggests that it may still slightly underestimate the true human costs. The majority of human losses occur in Asia, especially along the Himalayan Arc and in China. This geographical concentration dominates the annual landslide cycle, which peaks in the Northern Hemisphere summer months. Finally, numbers of fatalities per event show a fat-tailed power law distribution, with the density of landslides being moderately correlated with the population density on a national basis.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a finite-difference timedomain simulator that accurately models the interaction of microwaves with realistic soils, specifically from spaceborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The modeled soils are characterized by surface roughness, correlation length, bulk moisture content, vertical moisture gradient, and small airfilled-void content. Simulation results include both backscatter and interferometric phase, and we are particularly interested in assessing the potential of the latter as a proxy for soil moisture. We find that differences in homogeneous bulk moisture result in only small phase differences ({$<$} 5{$\smwhtcircle$}). In contrast, combinations of vertical moisture gradients and small air-filled voids, which may typically exist in more realistic soils, can produce phase changes {$>$} 30{$\smwhtcircle$} for HH and {$>$} 50{$\smwhtcircle$} for VV when the soil moisture is varied from 3\% to 30\% in the uppermost 2 cm of the soil. Phase changes of this magnitude are easily detectable by spaceborne InSAR techniques. While a strong phase response to a change in mean bulk moisture is common to vertical moisture gradient and small air-filled-void cases, their corresponding backscatter responses are very different. A vertical moisture gradient makes the backscatter response dramatically flatter compared with the case of uniform moisture; in contrast, the introduction of air-filled voids barely alters the backscatter. Thus, it may be possible to infer nearsurface soil-structure parameters such as vertical gradients or fractions of voids and inhomogeneities from combined SAR phase and backscatter data. Future SAR sensors could be optimized for this purpose. Prior theoretical work based on the assumption of vertically uniform soil-moisture distributions may need to be adjusted, and the lack of a theory that accommodates more complex soil structures may explain why backscatter inversions have yet to result in a viable operational system.},

  abstract = {Coseismic landslides pose immediate and prolonged hazards to mountainous communities, and provide a rare opportunity to study the effect of large earthquakes on erosion and sediment budgets. By mapping landslides using high-resolution satellite imagery, we find that the 25 April 2015 Mw7.8 Gorkha earthquake and aftershock sequence produced at least 25,000 landslides throughout the steep Himalayan Mountains in central Nepal. Despite early reports claiming lower than expected landslide activity, our results show that the total number, area, and volume of landslides associated with the Gorkha event are consistent with expectations, when compared to prior landslide-triggering earthquakes around the world. The extent of landsliding mimics the extent of fault rupture along the east-west trace of the Main Himalayan Thrust and increases eastward following the progression of rupture. In this event, maximum modeled Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA) and the steepest topographic slopes of the High Himalaya are not spatially coincident, so it is not surprising that landslide density correlates neither with PGA nor steepest slopes on their own. Instead, we find that the highest landslide density is located at the confluence of steep slopes, high mean annual precipitation, and proximity to the deepest part of the fault rupture from which 0.5\textendash 2 Hz seismic energy originated. We suggest that landslide density was determined by a combination of earthquake source characteristics, slope distributions, and the influence of precipitation on rock strength via weathering and changes in vegetation cover. Determining the relative contribution of each factor will require further modeling and better constrained seismic parameters, both of which are likely to be developed in the coming few years as post-event studies evolve. Landslide mobility, in terms of the ratio of runout distance to fall height, is comparable to small volume landslides in other settings, and landslide volume-runout scaling is consistent with compilations of data on larger slope failures. In general, the size ratios of landslide source area to full landslide area are smaller than global averages, and hillslope length seems to largely control runout distance, which we propose reflects a topographic control on landslide mobility in this setting. We find that landslide size dictates runout distance and that more than half of the landslide debris was deposited in direct connection with stream channels. Connectivity, which is defined as the spatial proximity of landslides to fluvial channels, is greatest for larger landslides in the high-relief part of the High Himalaya. Although these failures are less abundant than those at lower elevations, they may have a disproportionate impact on sediment dynamics and cascading hazards, such as landslide reactivation by monsoon rainfall and landslide dams that lead to outburst floods. The overall high fluvial connectivity of coseismic landsliding in the Gorkha event suggests coupling between the earthquake cycle and sediment/geochemical budgets of fluvial systems in the Himalaya.},

  abstract = {Decades of quantitative measurement indicate that roots can mechanically reinforce shallow soils in forested landscapes. Forests, however, have variations in vegetation species and age which can dominate the local stability of landslide-initiation sites. To assess the influence of this variability on root cohesion we examined scarps of landslides triggered during large storms in February and November of 1996 in the Oregon Coast Range and hand-dug soil pits on stable ground. At 41 sites we estimated the cohesive reinforcement to soil due to roots by determining the tensile strength, species, depth, orientation, relative health, and the density of roots {$^3$}1 mm in diameter within a measured soil area. We found that median lateral root cohesion ranges from 6.8\textendash 23.2 kPa in industrial forests with significant understory and deciduous vegetation to 25.6\textendash 94.3 kPa in natural forests dominated by coniferous vegetation. Lateral root cohesion in clearcuts is uniformly \textsterling 10 kPa. Some 100-year-old industrial forests have species compositions, lateral root cohesion, and root diameters that more closely resemble 10-year-old clearcuts than natural forests. As such, the influence of root cohesion variability on landslide susceptibility cannot be determined solely from broad age classifications or extrapolated from the presence of one species of vegetation. Furthermore, the anthropogenic disturbance legacy modifies root cohesion for at least a century and should be considered when comparing contemporary landslide rates from industrial forests with geologic background rates.},

  abstract = {Deep-seated landslides can have catastrophic impacts on human life and infrastructure when they suddenly fail. These events are devastating because of the large volumes of soil and rock masses involved and their often long runout. The present study suggests an energy-based method to determine when a landslide becomes unstable, giving critical values for measurable variables (velocity and basal temperature) up to which remediation actions can be deployed. This work focuses on large ancient landslides reactivated by dam-related water table variations that modify landslide stability. The main hypothesis of this work is that most of the deformation of deep-seated landslides is concentrated on a thin, basal shear band forming the sliding surface. In particular, this assumption allows an approximation of deep-seated landslides as elastic/rigid blocks sliding over a visco-plastic shear band, featuring weak phases like expansive clays. When the landslide moves, it causes friction in the shear band that raises the temperature of the clays until they become unstable and collapse catastrophically through a thermal runaway instability. The model is applied to the Vaiont landslide in Northern Italy and the Shuping landslide next to the Three Gorges Dam in China. The results of the model reproduce the sliding behavior of both landslides and provide constraints on the critical points of stability.},

  abstract = {Landslides can have significant and pervasive impacts to life and property around the world. Several attempts have been made to predict the geographic distribution of landslide activity at continental and global scales. These efforts shared common traits such as resolution, modeling approach, and explanatory variables. The lessons learned from prior research have been applied to build a new global susceptibility map from existing and previously unavailable data. Data on slope, faults, geology, forest loss, and road networks were combined using a heuristic fuzzy approach. The map was evaluated with a Global Landslide Catalog developed at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, as well as several local landslide inventories. Comparisons to similar susceptibility maps suggest that the subjective methods commonly used at this scale are, for the most part, reproducible. However, comparisons of landslide susceptibility across spatial scales must take into account the susceptibility of the local subset relative to the larger study area. The new global landslide susceptibility map is intended for use in disaster planning, situational awareness, and for incorporation into global decision support systems.},

  abstract = {Intended as an overview aimed at potential users of remotely sensed spatial distributions and temporal variations of soil moisture, this paper begins with an introductory section on the fundamentals of radar imaging and associated attributes. To place the soil moisture sensing task in proper perspective, the prerequisite step of classifying terrain into four basic types--bare surfaces, short vegetation, tall vegetation, and urban--is addressed by demonstrating how a dual-frequency polarimetric radar can correctly classify terrain with an accuracy greater than 90\%. Over 5000 image pixels with known terrain identity were involved in the evaluation of the radar image classifier. For bare soil (with vegetation cover shorter than 15 cm), radar can estimate the volumetric moisture content (expressed in per cent) of the top 5 cm soil layer with an r.m.s, error of 3.5\%. Based on theoretical model predictions as well as experimental observations, strong evidence exists in support of radar's potential for sensing soil moisture under vegetation cover, but no operational algorithm exists at present.},

  abstract = {Along the rugged coast of Big Sur, California, the Mud Creek landslide failed catastrophically on May 20, 2017, and destroyed over 400 m of scenic California State Highway 1. We collected structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry data using airborne platforms that, when combined with existing airborne lidar data, revealed that the area exhibited significant topographic change and displacement before, during, and after the catastrophic failure. Before the catastrophic failure, we document two areas of elevated change in the zone of depletion, which aligned with the double-peaked head scarp produced by the catastrophic failure. The catastrophic failure extended from 337-m elevation to at least 8 m below sea level, was 490 m wide, displaced \textasciitilde{} 3 million m3 of earth and rock, and deposited landslide debris at least 175 m seaward of the original shoreline. The failure was not a complete slope-clearing event, however, and several upslope and lateral regions that did not slip into the ocean exhibited significant displacement and topographic change during the days and months after the catastrophic failure. Additionally, we use the postslide data to quantify several other processes, including the timevarying rates of talus accumulation and coastal erosion of the landslide toe. We conclude that repeat SfM surveys from aerial imagery can provide valuable information about landslide evolution and the potential for deep-seated landslide hazards\textemdash especially in the lead up to catastrophic failure\textemdash if photos are collected and processed regularly.},

These techniques are capable to provide wide-area coverage (thousands of km2) and precise (mm\textendash cm resolution), spatially dense information (from hundreds to thousands of measurement points/km2) on ground surface deformations. New MTI application opportunities are emerging thanks to i) greater data availability from radar satellites, and ii) improved capabilities of the new space radar sensors (X-band Cosmo-SkyMed, C-band RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X) in terms of resolution (from 3 to 1 m) and revisit time (from 11 to 4 days for X-band acquisitions). This implies greater quantity and quality information about ground surface displacements and hence improved landslide detection and monitoring capabilities. Even though the applicability of MTI to regional and local-scale investigations of slow landslides has already been demonstrated, the awareness of the MTI utility and its technical limitations among landslide scientists and practitioners is still rather low. By referring to recent works on radar remote sensing, many regional and local scale MTI application examples from the geoscience literature and our own studies, we present an up-to-date overview of current opportunities and challenges in this field. We discuss relevant technical constraints and data interpretation issues that hamper the use of MTI in landslide assessment. Then guidelines on how to mitigate MTI technical limitations and avoid erroneous interpretations of radar-derived slope surface deformations are presented for the benefit of users lacking advanced knowledge in SAR applications. Finally, in view of the upcoming radar satellite launches, future perspectives on MTI applications are outlined and recommendations for applied research priorities are suggested. We foresee that with regular globe-scale coverage, improved temporal resolution (weekly or better) and freely available imagery, new radar satellite background missions such as the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 will guarantee ever increasing and more efficient use of MTI in landslide investigations. Furthermore, thanks to the improved temporal and spatial resolutions of the new generation radar sensors, significant breakthroughs are expected in detailed slope instability process modeling (e.g. kinematic and geotechnical models), as well as in the understanding of spatial and temporal patterns of landslide movement/activity and their relationships to causative or triggering factors (e.g. precipitation, seismic loading).},

Different mechanisms for this impact have been proposed, but its magnitude, sign and even presence remain poorly understood. In this study the dependence of the phase, the coherence magnitude as well as the phase triplets on soil moisture was inferred empirically with regression techniques: this was done for two airborne data sets at L-band. The phase dependence was significant (at a significance level of 0.05) for more than 70\% of the fields at HH polarization, its sign corresponding to an increase in optical path upon wetting, and the magnitude of the associated deformation commonly exceeding 2 cm for a change in soil moisture of 20\%. This trend was similar in both campaigns, whereas the prevalence of soil moisture-related decorrelation differs. These results are only consistent with a dielectric origin of the soil moisture effects, and not with soil swelling or the penetration depth hypothesis. Changes in vegetation impact the phase depending on the crop and polarization, with the vegetation influence at VV being more pronounced for the agricultural crops present in the study area.},
